        <spannedText>Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 85785**] is a very nice 36 year-old gentleman with history of smoking and hemoptysis who was recently diagnosed with a mediastinal mass who presented with hemoptysis. He had been well in his prior state of health until ~3 months ago when he started with cough and feeling upper back and left shoulder pain that occasionally went down his left arm and to his fingers. It was dull. He also reported feeling dizzy on occasion but did not relate that to any position or certain movement. He had been having dry cough since then but over the past 2 weeks started noting occasional blood streaked sputum once or twice in the am and later would not have any more hemoptysis. He presented to [**Hospital3 934**] Hospital where he was admitted on [**3-22**] and discharged on [**3-25**] and during that period he had a CT guided biopsy of the mass with the results inconclusive but showing malignant cells suggestive of carcinoma vs germ cell tumor. . The afternoon prior to admission, he started noting more blood in his phlegm which he quantified as a quarter of a dime when he cough blood. He estimates a total of around 15 ml from all episodes of hemoptysis over the previous day, with the amount each time and frequency stable. He denied having had any further episodes of hemoptysis since presenting to the ED. He also had noted 2 days prior a transient sharp pain in his left mid chest that he can point to with 3 fingers. . In our ER his initial VS were T 99.3 F, HR 123 BPM, BP 132/83 mmHg, RR 20 X', SpO2 98% on RA. He had slightly decreased breath sounds in the lower left of his chest. There was no wheezing. His ECG showed sinus tachycardia at 120 BPM without any signs of ischemia. His labs were significant for a microcytic normochromic anemia with HCT of 36. Coags were normal. He underwent a CT-PE, which showed a small PE in left upper lobe segmental artery. The mass in the upper mediastinum was visualized measuring 14x5 cm aprox and was compressing the pulmonary artery. His CT scan of his head showed no acute intracranial process. IP was consulted in regards to management of PE in a patient with a mediastinal mass and they recommended gentle anticoagulation with heparin gtt and possible rigid bronchoscopy with biopsy after admission.</spannedText>

        <spannedText>Upon transfer to the OMED service, patient was noted to be in sinus tachycardia to the 110s to 140s and normotensive requiring 4L NC for sats in the 90s. Imaging obtained as above showed large lung/mediastinal mass measuring 17.8 x 5.7 x 14.3 cm causing mass effect with shift of mediastinal structures to the right. The mass encased the left main pulmonary artery and markedly narrowed it causing a central filling defect within the left upper lobe segmental pulmonary artery. Given this large mass and no evidence of clot burden systemically, it was felt this was a pulmonary thrombus, not an embolus. Given his continued hemoptysis, it was again felt the risk of bleeding from systemic anticoagulation was higher than the benefit. He received no further anticoagulation during his hospital stay. MRI of head was negative for mets. CT Abd/Pelvis showed LAD in the celiac and retrocrural axis. Given these findings along with biopsy results consistent with squamous cell carcinoma, it was felt patient was at least Stage 3A SCCA Lung CA, however given the patient's pleural effusion and possible LAD below the diaphragm, patient's staging may be higher. Further staging will be performed in the outpatient once he receives a PET/CT. Patient was started on cisplatin/etoposide with concurrent XRT on HD9. During his treatment course, patient's hemoptysis improved from several teaspoons per hour to [**2-11**] teaspoons per day. He no longer needed supplemental oxygen and his tachycardia improved ranging from 80s to low 100s. After his final dose of etoposide he was discharged home with close follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**] for continued chemo/radiation.</spannedText>
