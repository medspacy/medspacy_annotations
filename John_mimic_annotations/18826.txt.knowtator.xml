        <spannedText>HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 24-year-old gentleman with a history of migraine headaches who was found unresponsive on [**7-13**]. Four days prior to admission the patient developed cool and numb hands. He then developed fatigue and upper extremity weakness two days prior to admission. Also, roughly two days prior to admission, the patient had symptoms of photophobia, lightheadedness, and a headache at that time. On the day of admission, the patient went to bed at 5 a.m. and awoke at 1:30 p.m., e-mailed a friend, and went back to bed at 3:30 p.m. Shortly thereafter, his friend found him unresponsive to voice and called Emergency Medical Service. Other history revealed the patient is originally from [**State 622**]. He had travelled to [**Hospital3 **] three days prior to admission and had been staying with friends. The patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit here and intubated for airway protection. He was also given some sedation, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir. Neurology Service and Infectious Disease Service were consulted. The patient was extubated roughly 18 hours later on [**7-14**].</spannedText>

        <spannedText>CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE: The impression was for a possible meningeal encephalitis, possibly herpes encephalitis. A host of Infectious Disease studies were sent; including Lyme titers, West [**Doctor First Name **] antibodies, and Eastern equine studies. The patient was continued on acyclovir and ceftriaxone. The patient's mental status improved over the course of the next three days; going from [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2611**] Coma Scale of 7 to being just slightly lethargic. He was responsive to individual voices and commands. He was fully interactive with Physical Therapy. The patient also had a magnetic resonance imaging early in the course of his admission which was also read as negative. Ultimately, all the patient's Infectious Disease workups came back negative; including herpes simplex virus PCR. Acyclovir was subsequently stopped. During the course of his admission, the patient had an electroencephalogram performed that was read as low voltage, suggestive of wide-spread encephalopathy. There were no areas of focal swelling, and no epileptiform activity was appreciated. Moreover, on hospital day three, more history was obtained from the patient suggestive of a bipolar disorder; including a history of racing of ideas and periods of writing stories in the middle of the night (writing up to 30 pages in one sitting). Psychiatry was consulted and felt that he did not have any acute psychiatric conditions.</spannedText>
