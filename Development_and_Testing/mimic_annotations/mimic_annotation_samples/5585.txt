CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Left chest pain and left sided weakness.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 57 year-old female
with diabetes, hypertension, renal insufficiency and a known
carotid stenosis of 79% by ultrasound on [**2125-7-13**] who
complains of chest pain and left arm weakness. The chest pain
awoke the patient from her sleep. The patient was awakened
from her sleep with a sharp radiating pain to the left
forehead, shoulder and arm associated with left arm weakness.
The patient has had previous episodes of left arm weakness
lasting several minutes. The first onset was [**2125-6-26**].
At that time she was seen by her primary care physician and
begun on aspirin. Her statin dosing was increased and she was
referred for carotid ultrasound and an echocardiogram.
Patient had a repeat episode on [**2125-7-13**] and was
encouraged to come to the emergency room but did not. The
patient had a third episode on the night of admission. The
patient had pain, weakness and paresthesias of the left face,
upper and lower extremities with residual diminished
sensation. The patient denies dyspnea, visual changes, loss
of consciousness, aphasia, hematuria, dysuria, neck pain.
Patient was initially evaluated in the emergency room and had
an electrocardiogram, a head CT and vascular was consulted.
Patient was begun on IV heparin drip at 1,000 units per hour
and the coagulations were monitored. She is now admitted to
the vascular service for definitive treatment.

vitamin B deficiency, supplemented. History of depression,
stable. History of osteoarthritis with spinal canal stenosis.

pressure 156/92 to 186/70, oxygen saturation 95% on 100% room
air. General appearance: Obese African American female
sitting in bed wearing a wig. Speech is clear. Head, eyes,
ears, nose and throat examination is unremarkable. Neck is
thick. There are no carotid bruits, no jugular venous
distension. No lymphadenopathy. Cardiovascular examination is
regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2. Lungs are
clear to auscultation without adventitious sounds. Abdominal
examination was obese with bowel sounds, nontender,
nondistended. A large ventral incision well healed. Rectal
examination showed normal tone, guaiac negative. Neurologic
examination: Cranial nerves 2 through 12 are grossly intact.
There is normal sensation. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+. Lower
extremity strength is 4+/5.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially evaluated in the
emergency room. An echocardiogram was done and it was
negative for atrial septal defect, PFO, ejection fraction was
greater than 55%. She has moderate pulmonary hypertension. A
PMIBI done on [**2125-1-30**] was negative for ischemic. A head CT
done was without hemorrhage or acute process. White count was
9.0, hematocrit 35.2, platelets 213,000. BUN 51, creatinine
3.0. Urine electrolytes were creatinine 33, sodium 99,
potassium 11. [**Doctor Last Name **] was 6.25. CK MB, troponins 192, 4 and less
than 0.1. Electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm, left
ventricular hypertrophy. The patient was maintained n.p.o.
Electrolytes were repleted. Her blood pressure was controlled
with metoprolol. Goal blood pressure 120s to 140s. Patient
was continued on heparin drip. Neurology was consulted. The
neurologic examination - mental status - the patient is
clear, awake, pleasant but slightly blunted affect. She is
oriented to person, place, time and president. She has good
attention span. She is able to recall in 10 seconds. Her
language is fluent with good comprehension, repetition.
Naming and [**Location (un) 1131**] intact. No dysarthria. There was no
apraxia, agnosia, no neglect. Able to calculate. No left to
right mismatch. Registration is 3 out 3. Object recall is 3
out 3 objects after three minutes. Cranial nerves are intact.
Sensory is normal touch, proprioception and pinprick are
normal. There is decreased vibration at the toes. No
extinction to double stimulus. Motor: There is wasting of the
thenar muscles on the left and bilateral EDBs. Increased leg
tone is mild. There is no fasciculations or drift. There is
no adventitious movements or asterixis. Strength is [**4-5**] on
the right. The toe is [**3-6**]. On the left the deltoids are [**3-6**].
Triceps [**3-6**]. Biceps are [**4-5**]. Hamstrings are [**3-6**]. DF and PFs
are [**4-5**]. Toes, E and F are [**3-5**]. Reflexes absent, biceps,
brachials, triceps. Patellar is 2+. Arch is 0. Toes are down
on the right. On the left the biceps, brachial are absent.
The triceps are 2+. The patellar is 2+. The arch is 0 and the
toes are downward. Normal finger to nose and heel to shin and
RAMs. Feet slight antalgic gait, unable to tandem, no
Romberg. Impression: This patient with multiple vascular risk
factors with two transient episodes of left sided weakness
and right internal carotid artery occlusion on an outpatient
basis. Patient has subtle peripheral polyneuropathy which is
probably secondary to diabetes or her vitamin B12 deficiency.
Stroke is high on the differential considering her symptoms.
Recommendations: MRI. Auto brachial latent blood pressure.
Telemetry overnight to rule out dysrhythmias. Consider a
transesophageal echocardiogram since the transthoracic
echocardiogram was normal. They also recommended the patient
be encouraged to follow up with the neurology clinic for
evaluation of her peripheral neuropathy versus radiculopathy.

An MRI of the brain was obtained which was negative for acute
infarct and an MRI of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] demonstrates flow
in the major branch of circulation. The study is
collaborative to the ultrasound which demonstrates a 70 to
79% right internal carotid artery stenosis and a left
internal carotid artery stenosis without stenosis. There is
antegrade vertebral flow bilaterally.

Patient underwent a right carotid endarterectomy without
incident on [**2125-7-18**]. During her hospitalization she
was followed by the renal service for her chronic renal
insufficiencies. They felt the patient's renal insufficiency
was related to diabetic nephropathy and hypertension,
question renal vascular hypertension as well. Recommended a
urine protein-creatinine ratio which was sent at the time of
dictation, an MRA which was scheduled at the time of
dictation. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] recommended changing the beta blockade
from atenolol to Toprol. Would considering adding [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] but
after discussing with him this will be done on follow up.
Patient's postoperative course was unremarkable. At the time
of discharge the patient was neurologically stable. Renal
function was stable. She was discharged to home. She should
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in three weeks time. She should
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the renal service. Post discharge
she should call for an appointment. Aspirin 81 mg q day was
started. The patient was instructed to call us should the
headache not relieve with Tylenol. She should not drive until
seen in follow up. She may otherwise take a shower. She
should continue her medications as directed. The patient
should call for her renal appointment at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 60**].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Carotid artery stenosis with a history
of transient ischemic attacks, status post right carotid
endarterectomy.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  Vitamin B12 500 mcg tablets 2
daily.
Alrestatin 40 mg daily.

Patient should continue to monitor her glucoses and follow up
with her primary care physician regarding her diabetic
management.
