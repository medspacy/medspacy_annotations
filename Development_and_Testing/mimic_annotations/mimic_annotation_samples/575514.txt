Pt 82 yo male who is transferred from OSH after presenting to PCP with
   several days of chest discomfort, congestion, fever, nausea and
   decreased appetite. Ruled in for NSTEMI, intubated for puml edema at
   [**Hospital 1991**] transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for futher care. Extubated [**6-21**] then later
   that day required mask ventilation for increased resp distress, puml
   edema, given lasix. Has cont to have fever, CXR with Staph PNA on R,
   antibiotics broadened.
   [**6-22**]- cardiac cath with clean coronaries, PCWP 15, CO 4.8, CI 2.25. R
   groin cath site CDI, no ooze/ no hematoma.
   [**6-23**]-patient stable and  transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 408**] 3. NSTEMI possibly caused
   by thrombus that had since resolved with medical therapy.  Likely
   demand ischemia in the setting of pneumonia. TTE with newly depressed
   EF 35-40% with inferolateral and apical hypokinesis
   [**6-24**]- re-admitted to CCU after rising temp and worsening SOB. Required
   intubation for respiratory distresse, Tmax 104. RIJ and ALine placed
   for hemodynamic monitoring.
   [**6-25**]- Pan Cultured- positive for MSSA sputum, on nafcillin and
   levofloxacin. Levophed for hypotension.
   [**Date range (1) 6194**]- Given Vit K for rising INR. Fluid boluses and weaning
   levophed to maintain MAP >50. TF held overnight for residuals > 100 ml,
   now re-started and running at 40 ml/hr. Tmax overnight- 101.5 oral
   Tcurrent- 100.8- blood cultures sent when temp spiked.
   Pneumonia, bacterial, community acquired (CAP)
   Assessment:
   Tmax 101.5 oral (102.8 rectal). Tcurrent 100.8 oral. CVP range 8-13
   overnight. HR 90
s when febrile, 80
s this am.   MAP
s > 50 overnight
   with SBP range 95-110. Per CCU team notes combination pneumonia/sepsis
   with persistent fevers c/b hypoxic respiratory failure/ARDS picture. LS
   remains diminished, scant suctioning for tan secretions. No vent
   changes made overnight.
   Action:
   MSSA Pneumonia: close temp monitoring, given IV nafcillin q 4 hours as
   ordered (also on levofloxacin q 48hours). Obtained BC
s with temp
   spike. Given 650 mg Tylenol in setting of temp spike. ID team
   following. Cooling blanket placed under patient. Nebs given by RRT. [**Name (NI) 1934**]
   protocol.
   ARDS: Maintianed vent and O2 sats > 95%. Frequent repositioning. AM ABg
   obtained. Pulmonary team following.
   Sepsis: hemodynamic monitoring with aline and CVP maintained [**9-13**] with
   no fluid boluses overnight, but Levophed gtt titrated to 0.06
   mcg/kg.min.
   Response:
   Pneumonia: temp slowly decreasing this am- cooling blanket not
   utilized. Culture data pending.
   ARDS: continued to maintain sats > 95% on CMV 50%, 500 x 20 with 8 of
   PEEP. Am RSBI 58. LS remain diminished but with some improvement
   following nebs. AM ABG- 7.36/36/116.
   Sepsis: remains hemodynamically stable as above with MAP
s > 60, HR
   80
s with some PVC
   Plan:
   Wean levophed as tolerated. ? expanding antibiotic coverage if fevers
   persist. Await results all pending culture data. CVP goal [**9-13**]. and MAP
   goal >60. Continue Nafcillin for total 3 week course through [**2119-7-11**]
   (start date [**6-21**], Vancomycin initiation date) and levofloxacin for
   total 8 day course ([**2119-6-24**] through [**2119-7-2**]). Wean vent settings with
   RRT/team as tolerated, continue [**Month/Day/Year 1934**] protocol.
   Impaired Skin Integrity
   Assessment:
   Patient with small burn over left chest wall (@ home patient placed hot
   water bottle over chest to relieve feeling of chest congestion).
   Patient also with dark bruising of oral mucosa present from arrival to
   CCU intubated from OSH on day of admission. Patient
s skin now taut
   with generalized edema from large volumes of fluid given to treat PNA
   sepsis c/b new diagnosis of  CHF with depressed EF of 35-40%.
   Action:
   SSD cream placed TID to burn on chest. Frequent oral care provided and
   INR monitored for bleeding risk. Aloe vesta cream to skin as well as
   frequent turning and repositioning to prevent skin breakdown. TF to
   support nutritional status (held overnight for high residual).
   Response:
   No signs of worsening of either burn injury or oral bruising. No new
   signs of skin breakdown. Patient remains with generalized edema [**3-8**] +.
   Am coag panel pending this am after vit K given yesterday. TF now
   re-started at 40 ml/hr.
   Plan:
   Continue TID SSD cream application, oral care and general skin
   care/repositioning. Continue to advance TF to goal as tolerated with
   residual checks. Monitor coagulation status with CCU team.
