   Assessment and Plan
   67-year-old man admitted with apparent septic shock, though no cultures
   positive to date.  Most likely source was stump infection.  PMH is
   quite complicated (including polycythemia, h/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 300**] 20%, VT s/p
   ablation).  Other major issue has included VT, which broke on
   lidocaine.
   1.       Refractory Vtach: restarted on lidocaine, which seems to have
   helped. Planned for VT ablation on Monday.
   2.       Sepsis.  Not clear precisely what source is.  Suspect that
   stump infection was major culprit; appreciate vascular
s help.  C diff
   has been a [**Last Name 551**] problem for him before.  If decompensates, further
   imaging, evaluation, and possible ID consult.
   3.       Resp Distress: has resolved.  He is stable on 5L n/c.  Would
   eventually consider thoracentesis for right-sided pleural effusion but
   would wait for VT ablation.
   4.       Cardiomyopathy: continue present rx
   5.      ARF on CRF: stable at present
   6.      Hypercoagulability:  on LMWH.  Hold before EP procedure.
   Remaining issues as per housestaff notes
   Patient is critically ill.
