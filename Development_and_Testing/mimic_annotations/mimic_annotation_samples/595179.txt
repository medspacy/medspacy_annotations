Urine culture from [**10-7**]: GRAM POSITIVE BACTERIA.    10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML.

         Lactobacillus sp.
   Rapid respiratory viral culture ([**10-8**]): pending
   Imaging:
   CXR today compared to [**10-9**]: poor penetration. compared to [**10-9**] CXR,
   left lung field is significantly clearer but the rigtht costophrenic
   angle continues to be blunted. No evidence of consolidation.
   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 27 yo female with MMP incl asthma, fibromyalgia
   and tobacco abuse admitted to ICU for hypoxia/respiratory distress.
   .
   # Respiratory distress/hypoxia: Likely [**2-29**] asthma exacerbation, with
   precipitating causes incl bacterial (atypical most likely) pneumonia,
   viral pneumonia, influenza and long-term tobacco use. Eosinophilic PNA
   less likely as no peripheral eosinophila, no other signs of vasculitis
   at this time.  Patient reports excessive mold in her building which
   could be significant given ddx includes hypersensitivity
   pneumonitis.    PFTs frm [**7-5**] are normal. Given steroid use, PCP also
   on diff.  CRP, ESR mildly elev making vasculitis unlikely. The leading
   differential is asthma with exacerbating viral pneumonia.
   - continue current regimen of singulair, MethylPREDNISolone Sodium Succ
   80 mg IV Q8, Xopenex Neb *NF* 0.63 mg Other q4-6H, Ipratropium Bromide
   Neb 1 NEB IH Q6H, Fluticasone Propionate 110mcg 2 PUFF IH [**Hospital1 **],
   Fluticasone-Salmeterol Diskus (250/50)  1 INH IH [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue on Levoquin for possible CAP vs atypical pna
   - f/u on resp viral culture
   - ABG if clinically declines
   - wean oxygen as tolerated
   - encourage ambulation
   - consider broadening coverage if no clinical improvement, also can
   consider bronchoscopy
   - also consider pulm edema from 2L NS pt received in ED, can consider
   Lasix
   .
   # Tobacco abuse: pt currently still a smoker
   - counsel pt to quit smoking
   - Nicotine patch
   .
   # Fibromyalgia: currently complains of bilat leg pain
   - continue home Percocet q4-6h PRN for pain
   - continue home Lyrica
   .
   # Depression: stable
   - continue home Cymbalta and Valium
   .
   # GERD/gasteoperesis:
   - continue home pantoprazole, Ranitidine
   - Ondesetron if needed
   .
   # Chest pain: can be due to PNA, PE, GERD, anxiety or ACS.  EKG shows
   no acute changes. Very low risk for CAD and sounds like chronic symptom
   for her. CE flat x2.
   -ekg prn
   -pain management with outpatient percocet
   .
   # Central Hypothyroidism:
   - need outpatient followup or can start workup on the floor to start
   with a head CT
   - previous cortstim from last year was wnl
   - consider other HPA axis labs such as prolactin, growth hormone, FSH
   .
   # Vit D def:
   - continue Ca, VitD suppl
   .
   # Thrush: on steroids
   - nystatin swish and swallow
