24 Hour Events:
   46F admitted overnight with stageIIIb melanoma on adjuvant chemotherapy
   with IFN therapy; developed myalgias, nausea, emesis and severe anion
   gap metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure, hypoglycemia of 1000,
   lactic acidosis of 5.6.  Also complained of productive cough.
   Overnight, she was treated with fluid resucitation and insulin gtt with
   improvement in her blood sugar and anion gap.   Complained of dull
   chest pain that resolved spontaneoulsy.  EKG checked and was without
   evidence of ischemia.

   Assessment and Plan
   46F with melanoma s/p IFN therapy last week, DMI; presents with DKA and
   metabolic dysarray.  Overall, trending in the right direction, though
   continues to feel poorly.
   1.  DKA:  Unclear inciting factor
 no evidence of infectious process,
   no evidence of non-compliance.  Anion gap closing
 currently AG 25,
   Glucose 300, pH 7.42, Na 146, K 3.7.
   - Remains tachycardic, appears hypovolemic.  Will bolus with NS 1000L
   and follow heart rate.
   - Continue insulin drip until anion gap closes, continue D5 1/2NS with
   potassium repletion for sugar source to allow for closure of the gap.
   - Will need to bridge with long-acting insulin prior to discontinuation
   of insulin gtt.
   - Advance diet as tolerated when can take PO.
   - Evaluation for inciting factors: cardiac markers negative, UA
   negative, CXR without PNA.
   - Will discuss with endocrinology as she is followed at [**Last Name (un) 276**].
   2.  ID:  Does have a leukocytosis without left shift on differential.
   Likley concentrated. She is afebrile and as above no clear source of
   infection.
   - Will follow up culture data
   - No role for antibiotics given current clinical picture
   3. Renal:  ARF from dehydration/hypovolemia from osmotic diuresis with
   hyperglycemia
   - Cr improved today (peaked at about 2.5)
   - Will follow lytes
   4. Oncology: Undergoing IFN therapy for her melanoma.
   - Contact oncology to discuss therapy, she is due tomorrow for next
   dose.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Currently on D5 1/2NS, await improvement in her appetite and
   can start DM diet
   Glycemic Control:  Insulin gtt
   Lines:
   18 Gauge - [**2145-10-25**] 03:10 AM
   Prophylaxis:
   DVT: heparin
   Stress ulcer: No indication for PPI
   Code status: Full code
   Disposition :  Remain in ICU today for insulin gtt and close monitoring
   of electrolytes
   Time Spent : 45 min
