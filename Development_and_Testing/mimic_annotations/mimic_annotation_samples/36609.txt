Bilateral Pulmonary Emboli

History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness: 19 yo female with no past medical
history transferred from [**Hospital 1474**] hospital for bilateral PEs.
She was at the gym this morning, began to feel faint and
lightheaded, and on the way to the bathroom, she lost
consciousness. She thinks she may have been unconscious for
about a minute or so, and subsequently EMS was called and she
was transferred to [**Hospital1 1474**]. She denies any dyspnea or chest
pain prior to or after the syncopal event. She denies symptoms
of lower or upper extremity swelling. At [**Hospital1 1474**], she had a
positive d-dimer, then had a CTA chest which showed large right
sided PE obstructing the distal main right pulmonary artery, as
well as other segmental right arteries, and segmental left
arteries as well. She was bolused with heparin there, and
started on a heparin gtt at 1050 units/hr and was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 99.5, 143/107, 18, 97%2L. Her
initial labs showed a normal chemistry and CBC, but a trop of
0.09. She had a re-read of the CT which showed the same findings
as above. Her vitals prior to transfer were 98.1, 85, 134/84,
24, 97%2L. She was given 850 cc of IVFs while she was in the ED.

.
Pt denies chest pain, shortness of breath, pleuritic pain. She
denies any other symptoms. She denies lightheadedness or
dizziness at this time. She reports using OCPs, but denies
smoking history. Her mother was diagnosed with a RUE DVT 1.5 yrs
ago with subsequent PE and was treated with anticoagulation.
Patient has been on OCPs for about 6 months. Of note, she just
started period today. She denies any recent trauma, no MVAs, no
recent surgeries, no melena, no seizure history.

BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS Study Date of [**2108-8-11**] 4:46 PM
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of DVT.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY Study Date of [**2108-8-11**]
IMPRESSION: Extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli involving the
left and right main pulmonary arteries and branches as
characterized above with evidence of right heart strain. These
findings should be correlated
with echocardiography.

Echo:
IMPRESSION: Dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle with
evidence of pressure/volume overload. Mild pulmonary artery
hypertension (may be underestimated). Normal left ventricular
function. No significant valvular abnormality seen.

Right 3rd finger xray: FINDINGS: There is a fracture involving
the volar base of the middle phalanx
of the long finger. This is at the expected attachment of the
flexor
digitorum superficialis tendon.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: This is a 19 year old with no PMH transfer
from [**Hospital1 1474**] with bilateral PE's.
.
# Massive Pulmonary Embolism: patient was noted to have syncopal
episode while at the gym yesterday, and was taken to [**Hospital 1474**]
hospital where she was found to have b/l PEs. She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] and initially was admitted to the MICU. Pt
did have evidence of right heart strain on both transthoracic
echocardiogram and by EKG. Pt remained hemodynamically stable
and the decision was made against lysis with TPA. Pt was
therefore transferred to the floor several hours later.
Bilateral lower extremity ultrasounds did not show evidence of
DVT. Pt was anticoagulated with heparin gtt throughout her stay
and was bridged to coumadin with 48 hours of overlap (when both
her INR and PTT were therapeutic). She was discharged on
coumadin.
.
Pt's only risk factors for PE are FH of clotting and oral
contraceptives. Pt did not take her contraceptives while in the
hospital and was advised to not take oral contraceptives in the
future. She was also advised to discuss all future contraceptive
decisions (aside from condoms) with her hematologist as other
hormonal contraceptives can also carry an increased risk of
clotting. Pt will follow up with  with her primary care doctor
(who will follow her INR) and hematologist.
.
#S/P FALL: Pt had syncopal episode at gym without hitting her
head. She did have swelling and pain in her right third finger
which was found to have a non-displaced avulsion fracture.
Plastic surgery saw her and gave her a brace for the finger. She
will follow-up in hand clinic.

Discharge Disposition:
Home

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary Diagnosis: Pulmonary Emboli, R middle finger fracture
Secondary Diagnoses: none


Discharge Condition:
good; ambulating, breathing without difficulty; requiring low
activity level to avoid tachycardia


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to [**Hospital1 **] Hospital because of
several clots in the arteries that go to your lungs (pulmonary
arteries). We looked at your heart with ultrasound (called an
echocardiogram) and monitored your heart rate while you were
here; both the echocardiogram and your heart rate made us think
that your heart is having to work harder than usual to pump
blood through your lung arteries. This means that when you go
home you need to be very calm, walk slowly, not exercise or lift
heavy things, and not go to work until either your primary care
doctor or your hematologist says that you are well enough to do
those things.

You were started on several medicines (heparin and coumadin)
which help to prevent the clots from growing. At this point, the
coumadin levels are high enough to prevent further clotting
without the heparin (which you can only get in the hospital), so
we are sending you home on the coumadin alone.

You should take 4mg of coumadin every day in the evening until
you see your doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 2974**]. He will check your coumadin level
(called an INR) and then he may increase or decrease your dose
based on the blood test. Make sure you discuss your INR and your
coumadin dose before you leave his office on [**Last Name (Titles) 2974**]. If your INR
is not back by the time you leave his office, please make sure
you know what time to call the office to find out what your
coumadin dose should be. They should also be able to tell you
when your next blood test will be (probably sometime next week).


Please return to the hospital for fainting or shortness of
breath. Please call your doctor or return to the hospital for
chest pain or lightheadedness or any other symptoms which are
concerning to you.

Followup Instructions:
You have already made appointments with your primary care doctor
