   Assessment and Plan
   67 M with metastatic RCC, h/o GIB c malignant ulcer, p/w BRBPR for 2
   days and admitted to MICU for careful hemodynamic monitoring.
   .
   # GI Bleed: Likely related to a metastatic lesion, complicated by
   starting stutent. Patient has a history of bleeding GI masses, and had
   been temporarily stopped in Atrasentan trial for anemia.  EGD showed no
   bleeding from duodenal/ampullary mass or hematobilia.  He thus likely
   has a lower GI source, which is consistent with colonoscopy with blood
   throughout.  Pt had RBC scan w/ bleeding at 60min and nothing on angio,
   then had more BRBPR in the MICU, was re-RBC scanned w/ bleeding at 7
   min, and was re-angioed this am, where they embolized areas around
   tumor, but did not see any large bleeds. Pt stable since angiography.
   - 2 large bore peripheral IVs in place
   - GI and surgery consulted, appreciate recs,
   - continue Pantoprozole [**Hospital1 7**]
   - HCT stable x 24 hours. Repeat HCT at noon. If stable will call out
   from MICU.
   - will return to angio for new bleeding, or if pt unstable to surgery.
   .
   # Hypertension
 Initially holding outpatient regiment of Atenolol 50
   mg, diltiazem 360 mg, and lisinopril 40 mg daily.  Will tolerate higher
   blood pressures in the setting of active bleeding and avoid
   beta-blockers as they could mask hypovolemic tachycardia. Diltiazem
   restarted due to tachycardia, thought [**12-23**] withdrawal outpt meds
   - IV nitroglycerin as needed for SBP > 180
   .
   # Renal Cell cancer
   - stable, Oncology aware
   .
   #) F/E/N:
   - ADAT
   - Hold on IVF
   - Lytes PRN, follow Ca while getting treasfusions.
   .
   #) Glycemic Control:
   .
   #) Access.
    18G, 1 22G peripheral IVs.
   .
   #) Prophylaxis.
   - Pneumoboots, Pantoprazole [**Hospital1 7**], No Bowel regimen indicated.
   .
   #) Communication.  Daughter is HCP, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 2145**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2146**].  Wife
   can make decisions too.  Phone [**0-0-**].
   ICU and blood consent signed and in chart.
   .
   #) Code Status.
   FULL, confirmed with patient.  (He is still considering, but will
   remain full code for now.)
   .
   #) Dispo: MICU pending stabilization of bleeding. If stable tonight,
   consider c/o to floor tomorrow.
