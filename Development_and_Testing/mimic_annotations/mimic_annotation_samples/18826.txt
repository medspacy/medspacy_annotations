degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate was 81, and his blood pressure
was 144/90.  His pupils were equal, round, and reactive to

sent; including Lyme titers, West [**Doctor First Name **] antibodies, and
Eastern equine studies.

The patient was continued on acyclovir and ceftriaxone.  The
patient's mental status improved over the course of the next

just slightly lethargic.  He was responsive to individual
voices and commands.  He was fully interactive with Physical
Therapy.  The patient also had a magnetic resonance imaging
early in the course of his admission which was also read as
negative.

Ultimately, all the patient's Infectious Disease workups came
back negative; including herpes simplex virus PCR.  Acyclovir
was subsequently stopped.

During the course of his admission, the patient had an
electroencephalogram performed that was read as low voltage,
suggestive of wide-spread encephalopathy.  There were no
areas of focal swelling, and no epileptiform activity was
appreciated.

Moreover, on hospital day three, more history was obtained
from the patient suggestive of a bipolar disorder; including
a history of racing of ideas and periods of writing stories
in the middle of the night (writing up to 30 pages in one
sitting).  Psychiatry was consulted and felt that he did not
have any acute psychiatric conditions.
