HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 50463**] was an 83-year-old
female with a history of polymyalgia rheumatica,
hypercholesterolemia, hypothyroidism, vertigo, postural
hypotension, and a history of syncope in the past who now is
on Florinef and presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**]
emergency department on [**2180-9-22**] after a syncopal episode
at home.  She reported that she passed out after urinating
while on the toilet.  She awoke and called her primary care
physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] evaluated her in the office and suspected
dehydration, rehydrated her with fluids, and sent her home.
At home she continued to feel poorly, and her primary care
physician told her to return to the Emergency Department.  At
[**Location (un) 620**] emergency department on [**2180-9-23**] EKG revealed
polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with rate in the 130s and
blood pressure in the 140s to 150s/60s.  She was afebrile at
this time.

Labs in the Emergency Room revealed a potassium of 2.7 and
magnesium of 1.6.  She was given electrolyte repletion and
her ventricular tachycardia spontaneously converted to sinus
rhythm.  She had normal cardiac enzymes and a normal chest
x-ray.  She was admitted on the morning after admission and
was seen by Electrophysiology, who recommended a Lidocaine
drip.  Despite avid electrolyte repletion, her potassium
remained low, and a right internal jugular central line was
placed on [**2180-9-23**] for further resuscitation.  Later that
evening her oxygen saturations dropped to the 60s or 70s, and
a post central line placement chest x-ray revealed no
evidence of pneumothorax but evidence of pulmonary edema.
She was placed on 100% non-rebreather and her sats improved
to 80 to 100%.  An ABG at this time showed a pH of 7.36, CO2
of 54, and PA of 53.  Potassium was 3.5 at this time.

A decision was made to give 20 mg of intravenous Lasix, and
she put out 620 cc of urine, but her sats continued to be 80
to 100%.  Repeat ABG still revealed persistently low
oxygenation.  Decision was made to intubate.  The patient was
placed on AC at the rate of 10 with a tidal volume of 500 and
FIO2 of 100% and PEEP of 5.  Recheck of an ABG still showed
poor oxygenation with [**MD Number(3) 50464**], and decision was made to
transfer her to [**Hospital6 256**] for
further management due to failure of oxygenation.

She was transferred, intubated, and a Lidocaine drip and
received 100 mg of Fentanyl and 50 mg of Versed.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Ms. [**Known lastname 50463**] was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
on [**2180-9-25**].  The initial feeling was that she most likely
was in pulmonary edema, leading to poor oxygenation due to
aggressive fluid and electrolyte replacement at [**Location (un) 620**].  She
was ........... diuresed, and was successfully extubated on
[**2180-9-27**], however, became febrile with known MSSA in her
sputum, however, was persistently febrile despite treatment
with Levofloxacin, Vancomycin, and Flagyl.  Call for concern
of aspiration pneumonia.  She also had an elevated white
count with evidence of bandemia.

On [**2180-9-29**] she also developed a decreased urine output in
the setting of febrile illness, and there was concern for
sepsis.  Her urine output continued to climb despite fluid
boluses.  Her volume status was unclear but most likely
representative of total body fluid overload with decreased
intervascular volume, and plans were made for placement of a
PA catheter.

Despite concern for sepsis, her mental status continued to
improve from the time of admission.  However, the house
officers called on [**2180-9-29**] in the afternoon due to
decreased mental status, tachypnea, bradycardia, and
hypotension.  Passed away on [**2180-9-29**] at 15:50.  She had
been made "Do Not Resuscitate"/ "Do Not Intubate" at the time
of admission.  No resuscitative measures were done.  Her
family was immediately [**Name (NI) 653**], and the Attending was
present.  No autopsy was requested.  Immediate cause of death
was pneumonia/adult respiratory distress syndrome with other
causes including renal failure and cardiac arrest.
