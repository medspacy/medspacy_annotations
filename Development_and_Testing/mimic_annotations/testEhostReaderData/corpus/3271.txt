HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 71 year old,
woman with hypertension, high cholesterol, thoracic abdominal
aortic repair times two.  The patient has also been unable to do
her activities of daily living, due to generalized weakness that
started suddenly at the time of her second thoracic aneurysm
repair.  On [**6-14**], she was in her usual state of health
when she was noted by her family to be asleep in her chair
and slumped to the right at 6 p.m.  They tried to wake her a
couple of hours later.  She mumbled a few words and went back
to sleep.  Then at 10 p.m., they again tried to arouse her
and had difficulty. She could not answer a few simple
questions after much prodding and could not open her eyes.
They noticed that she had a left facial droop and her left
side was weak but she was able to grip her hands on either
side.

She was brought to [**Hospital 882**] hospital via ambulance with a
head CT revealed a right thalamic hemorrhage.  She was
agitated and received 1 mg of Ativan, after which she became
much more lethargic.  Her blood pressure was erratic, ranging
from 83 to 54 to 183/141.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for further treatment.  The patient
was then transferred to Neurologic Intensive Care Unit for
further management of her hypertensive hemorrhagic stroke.
Magnetic resonance scan of the head revealed right thalamic
hemorrhage confirmed by CT, measuring 1.2 by 1.3 by 1.5 cms.
Imaging studies showed midline shift or ventricular
extension.  The patient's blood pressure was vigorously
controlled in the neurologic Intensive Care Unit with
Labetalol and betablockers.  The patient had labile blood
pressures in the neurologic Intensive Care Unit for a two to
three day course but systolic pressures were maintained
between 120 and 140. The patient was also treated with
Levofloxacin for urinary tract infection on urinalysis.
The patient stabilized in neurologic Intensive Care Unit and
was transferred to the floor for further blood pressure
management and disposition.  The patient's blood pressure was
controlled on medication of Labetalol.  An ace inhibitor was
not added to the pharmacologic regimen.

The patient was then stabilized on beta-blocker and had
appropriate physical therapy, speech therapy and occupational
therapy screens.  The patient was deemed not to be able to
swallow autonomously and had percutaneous endoscopic
gastrostomy tube placed one day prior to discharge.  The
patient finished course of antibiotics for urinary tract
infection with repeat head CT later on admission showing
unchanging right thalamic hemorrhage.

On physical examination the patient had blood pressure of
98/60 to 190/120 on admission, which was very labile, but
then stabilized throughout admission. Pulse was between 70
and 90. Respiratory rate of 13.  The patient was afebrile on
admission.

Throughout admission, the patient was somnolent on general
examination with decreased arousability. The patient had a
supple neck with normal S1 and S2, 2/6 systolic murmur.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen was
soft and extremities had no edema with distal pulses intact
with no rashes.  On neurologic examination, the patient was
only arousable to noxious stimuli on left side and right side
on admission, with improvement in alertness and arousability
prior to discharge. The patient was able to follow simple
commands on the right side, with severe left neglect.  The
patient was dysarthric with sparse output.  She will say name
and simple phrases in response to questioning.

The patient's ability to follow commands improved and she was
able to perform simple commands prior to discharge.  The
patient also had a right gaze deviation and a dense left
hemiparesis on neurologic examination, with arm greater than
leg.  The patient was unable to tract extraocular movements
past the midline and unable to withdraw from painful stimulus
on the left arm.  On motor examination, the patient had
increased tone on the left with 4+/5 right hand grasp,
triceps with the left [**1-6**] grasp; positive pronator drift on
the left with difficulty assessing lower extremities as the
patient could not cooperate with the examination. On cranial
nerve examination, the patient had left facial droop with, as
mentioned, a right gaze deviation and difficulty crossing
midline.  The patient was unable to cooperative with
coordination examination or gait examination.

LABORATORY DATA:  The patient had a video swallow study on
[**6-21**] which showed no evidence of aspiration or
penetration of vocal cords, with a delay in volitional
swallow, with trouble initiating.  Due to trouble initiating,
the patient had gastric tube placed on [**2100-6-25**] to
augment nutrition with successful G tube passage of food and
liquid.

On [**6-20**], the patient also had CT of the head without
contrast for follow-up which showed no mass effect or shift
of normal midline structures.  There was note made of
moderate vascular ectasia and neural calcifications, likely
related to atherosclerosis with unchanged right thalamic
hemorrhage size.

The patient also had electrolytes and CBC monitored very
closely during admission for supplementation and supportive
care.  The patient did spike white blood cell count during
urinary tract infection which was diagnosed early in
admission but white count subsided prior to discharge.  The
patient was also afebrile prior to discharge.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  As mentioned, the patient was transferred
to neuro-medicine where gastrointestinal consult inserted a
gastric tube for p.o. augmentation nutrition. Decision to
place G tube was discussed with the patient's family who
desired the patient to have supplemental nutrition until the
patient could successfully eat on her own and initiate
swallowing as an outpatient.  The patient will now be
transfer to the rehabilitation facility for strengthening of
left sided hemiparesis and rehabilitation of dysarthria and
swallowing.

According to the patient's primary medical doctor, the
patient has a baseline functional status of decreased
arousability and decreased cognition at baseline. These finding
are suggestive of a neurodegenerative process such as dementia of
Alzheimer's type.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:

-1 Right thalamic, hemorrhagic stroke.

-2 Possible dementia of Alzheimer's type

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Prednisone 5 mg p.o. q. day.
Metoprolol 75 mg p.o. three times a day. Atorvistatin one
tablet p.o. q. day. Docusate sodium, one capsule oral twice a
day. Senna one capsule oral twice a day. Acetaminophen 650 mg
q. eight hours prn fever/headache. Protonic 15 mg capsule
p.o. q. day.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient will follow-up with
primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 15276**], at phone number
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 6803**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 15276**] has been in contact regarding this
admission prior to discharge.  The patient will be going to
rehabilitation facility.
