Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the [**Hospital1 18**] emergency department as a
basic trauma on [**2170-1-13**], and had CT head, C-spine, chest,
abdomen, and pelvis as detailed above.  He was admitted to the
TICU, with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 518**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 519**], Attending Physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
Neurosurgery team was immediately consulted regarding his
subdural hematoma.  He was loaded with dilantin, and a repeat
head CT was performed the subsequent day, [**2170-1-14**], which did not
demonstrate any change. On [**2170-1-14**] he remained intubated on
propofol gtt in the TICU.  He continued to have q1hour neuro
checks, but his neuro exam was inconsistent. There was question
whether he was moving his lower extremities at all. A MRI Head,
T and L spine was performed at night. Subarachnoid blood was
seen in the spinal canal, but it was not felt to be impinging on
the cord.  On [**2170-1-15**] he was extubated, and neurology was
consulted due to concern for lower extremity weakness.
Recommendations by neurology were to continue dilantin and to
start manitol to reduce ICP.  On [**2170-1-16**], he was found to be A&O
x1 only and a repeat head CT showed no significant change. On
[**2170-1-17**] patient was taken to the OR for IVC and PEG tube
placement which was performed without complication however
postoperative the patient developed anisocoria with dilation of
the right pupil which resolved spontaneously. Another repeat
head CT was negative. TF were also started on [**2170-1-17**] and were
advanced to goal on [**2170-1-19**]. Patient was extubated on [**2170-1-19**]
and the mannitol was discontinued. Was transfered to the floor
on [**2170-1-20**] and screening for rehab was undertaken. Patient had
physical therapy work with him allowing him to be able to go
from the bed to the chair. On [**2170-1-22**] the neurology team felt as
though his reflexes were decreased in his right leg and an MRI
was done which showed no acute processes. Per neurology, his
dilantin may be weaned at rehab.  Patient will need to schedule
an appointment with neurology to be followed as an outpatient.
On [**2170-1-23**] patient was deemed stable for discharge. Upon
discharge patient was tolerated tube feeds at goal, was able to
tolerate being transferred from the bed to chair, continued to
have decreased movement in his lower extremities and had no
other acute surgical issues. He is oriented x1 when awake.  He
is incontinent of bladder and bowels, and requires a diaper.  On
discharge his SaO2 was 100% on 2L.  This may be weaned as
tolerated.  Patient will be transferred to a rehabilitation
facility and will follow up in clinic in [**1-10**] weeks.
