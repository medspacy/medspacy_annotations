        <spannedText>Assessment and Plan 67-year-old man admitted with apparent septic shock, though no cultures positive to date. Most likely source was stump infection. PMH is quite complicated (including polycythemia, h/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 300**] 20%, VT s/p ablation). Other major issue has included VT, which broke on lidocaine. 1. Refractory Vtach: restarted on lidocaine, which seems to have helped. Planned for VT ablation on Monday. 2. Sepsis. Not clear precisely what source is. Suspect that stump infection was major culprit; appreciate vascular s help. C diff has been a [**Last Name 551**] problem for him before. If decompensates, further imaging, evaluation, and possible ID consult. 3. Resp Distress: has resolved. He is stable on 5L n/c. Would eventually consider thoracentesis for right-sided pleural effusion but would wait for VT ablation. 4. Cardiomyopathy: continue present rx 5. ARF on CRF: stable at present 6. Hypercoagulability: on LMWH. Hold before EP procedure. Remaining issues as per housestaff notes Patient is critically ill.
