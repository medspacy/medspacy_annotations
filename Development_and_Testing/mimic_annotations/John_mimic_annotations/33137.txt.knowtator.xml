        <spannedText>Brief Hospital Course: The patient was brought to the [**Hospital1 18**] emergency department as a basic trauma on [**2170-1-13**], and had CT head, C-spine, chest, abdomen, and pelvis as detailed above. He was admitted to the TICU, with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 518**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 519**], Attending Physician. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] Neurosurgery team was immediately consulted regarding his subdural hematoma. He was loaded with dilantin, and a repeat head CT was performed the subsequent day, [**2170-1-14**], which did not demonstrate any change. On [**2170-1-14**] he remained intubated on propofol gtt in the TICU. He continued to have q1hour neuro checks, but his neuro exam was inconsistent. There was question whether he was moving his lower extremities at all. A MRI Head, T and L spine was performed at night. Subarachnoid blood was seen in the spinal canal, but it was not felt to be impinging on the cord. On [**2170-1-15**] he was extubated, and neurology was consulted due to concern for lower extremity weakness. Recommendations by neurology were to continue dilantin and to start manitol to reduce ICP. On [**2170-1-16**], he was found to be A&amp;O x1 only and a repeat head CT showed no significant change. On [**2170-1-17**] patient was taken to the OR for IVC and PEG tube placement which was performed without complication however postoperative the patient developed anisocoria with dilation of the right pupil which resolved spontaneously. Another repeat head CT was negative. TF were also started on [**2170-1-17**] and were advanced to goal on [**2170-1-19**]. Patient was extubated on [**2170-1-19**] and the mannitol was discontinued. Was transfered to the floor on [**2170-1-20**] and screening for rehab was undertaken. Patient had physical therapy work with him allowing him to be able to go from the bed to the chair. On [**2170-1-22**] the neurology team felt as though his reflexes were decreased in his right leg and an MRI was done which showed no acute processes. Per neurology, his dilantin may be weaned at rehab. Patient will need to schedule an appointment with neurology to be followed as an outpatient. On [**2170-1-23**] patient was deemed stable for discharge. Upon discharge patient was tolerated tube feeds at goal, was able to tolerate being transferred from the bed to chair, continued to have decreased movement in his lower extremities and had no other acute surgical issues. He is oriented x1 when awake. He is incontinent of bladder and bowels, and requires a diaper. On discharge his SaO2 was 100% on 2L. This may be weaned as tolerated. Patient will be transferred to a rehabilitation facility and will follow up in clinic in [**1-10**] weeks.</spannedText>

        <mentionClass id="Symptom_Section">Brief Hospital Course: The patient was brought to the [**Hospital1 18**] emergency department as a basic trauma on [**2170-1-13**], and had CT head, C-spine, chest, abdomen, and pelvis as detailed above. He was admitted to the TICU, with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 518**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 519**], Attending Physician. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] Neurosurgery team was immediately consulted regarding his subdural hematoma. He was loaded with dilantin, and a repeat head CT was performed the subsequent day, [**2170-1-14**], which did not demonstrate any change. On [**2170-1-14**] he remained intubated on propofol gtt in the TICU. He continued to have q1hour neuro checks, but his neuro exam was inconsistent. There was question whether he was moving his lower extremities at all. A MRI Head, T and L spine was performed at night. Subarachnoid blood was seen in the spinal canal, but it was not felt to be impinging on the cord. On [**2170-1-15**] he was extubated, and neurology was consulted due to concern for lower extremity weakness. Recommendations by neurology were to continue dilantin and to start manitol to reduce ICP. On [**2170-1-16**], he was found to be A&amp;O x1 only and a repeat head CT showed no significant change. On [**2170-1-17**] patient was taken to the OR for IVC and PEG tube placement which was performed without complication however postoperative the patient developed anisocoria with dilation of the right pupil which resolved spontaneously. Another repeat head CT was negative. TF were also started on [**2170-1-17**] and were advanced to goal on [**2170-1-19**]. Patient was extubated on [**2170-1-19**] and the mannitol was discontinued. Was transfered to the floor on [**2170-1-20**] and screening for rehab was undertaken. Patient had physical therapy work with him allowing him to be able to go from the bed to the chair. On [**2170-1-22**] the neurology team felt as though his reflexes were decreased in his right leg and an MRI was done which showed no acute processes. Per neurology, his dilantin may be weaned at rehab. Patient will need to schedule an appointment with neurology to be followed as an outpatient. On [**2170-1-23**] patient was deemed stable for discharge. Upon discharge patient was tolerated tube feeds at goal, was able to tolerate being transferred from the bed to chair, continued to have decreased movement in his lower extremities and had no other acute surgical issues. He is oriented x1 when awake. He is incontinent of bladder and bowels, and requires a diaper. On discharge his SaO2 was 100% on 2L. This may be weaned as tolerated. Patient will be transferred to a rehabilitation facility and will follow up in clinic in [**1-10**] weeks.</mentionClass>
