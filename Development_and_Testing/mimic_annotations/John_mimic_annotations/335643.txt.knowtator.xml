Suspect acute compromise in airway is related to procedure; however, no clear findings on fiberoptic imaging while intubating. Per ENT, pt's sridor could be rebound subglottic swelling from recent procedure, however this usually doesn't happen in this time frame. Anterior neck collection may be related to airway compromise given its size. Again, suspect that this collection is related to recent procedure. [**Month (only) 60**] be early infectious collection vs. edema. Not drainable at present. - Continue empiric treatment with clindamycin as well as vanc and Zosyn - brief course of increased steroids to attempt to decrease extent of neck swelling - keep intubated for now; will d/w ENT &amp; anesthesia to coordinate possible extubation today/tomorrow - Monitor neck for increasing size of mass - ENT following # Fevers: Low grade temps overnight.

Recent tracheal dilation [**7-27**] at [**Hospital 3414**]. Presented [**7-30**] with respiratory distress and stridor requiring fiberoptic nasal intubation. CT neck showed anterior fluid collection. 24 hour events: -steroids increased to decadron 4mg IV q6hr -cuff leak this morning meds: clindamycin 900mg IV q8, vancomycin 1gm IV q12hr, Zosyn 3.375 gm IV q8hr, Decadron 10mg IV q8r, propofol gtt, Exam notable for Tm 100.1 99.2 BP 147/97 HR 65 RR 15 with sat 100% on AC 600/16/5/35% I/O 1700/1600 over 24 hrs Intubated, sedated.

INR 1.6 micro: NGTD CXR with improving LLL infiltrate Neck CT [**7-31**] with persistent supraglottic edema Agree with plan to 1) tracheal stenosis with recent dilation procedure, now with subglottic edema -continue dexamethasone at current dose for now -with cuff leak so likely ready for extubation but will need to have anesthesia (and if available, ENT) services present 2) rising WBC count with fevers -continue zosyn, vancomycin, and clindamycin for now -deep tracheal aspirate and urine culture, blood culture 3) rising Cr 0.7(may be spuriously low) to 1.3 -Cr is actually stable as Cr 0.7 was from diluted sample -resume lasix at home dose today 4) afib with CVA in past -can hold coumadin for now as may need procedures, can resume if successful extubation 5) access -PICC to be placed today FULL CODE Remainder of plan as outlined above.
