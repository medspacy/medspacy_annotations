        <spannedText>A/P 39 yo male with relapsed Hodgkins Disease on CEPP chemo, w/ SVC syndrome here for TPA infusion via portocath. 1. SVC syndrome - The patient was admitted to the ICU. He was started on a heparin drip. He had an infusion of low dose TPA with no change in fibrinogen or INR but the follow up venogram showed some residual clot. He then underwent mechanical removal with the Possis angiojet and suction thrombectomy of about 80% of this clot. There was some residual clot but there was free flow in the superior vena cava so it was left. He was maintained on heparin gtt and transferred to the floor. He was started on coumadin in addition to the heparin, but after several days of uptitrating the dose, he still remained subtherapeutic. He remained clinically stable during this time, so the decision was made to switch him to lovenox so he could be discharged. He was maintained on heparin for several hours after starting lovenox, then his heparin was stopped. He was d/cd to home after the case manager assured that his insurance would cover part of the lovenox. . 2. Hodgkins Lymphoma- The patient recently finished his second cycle of CEPP. A repeat PET was done on [**12-8**] which showed possible new disease in the LUL and stable disease in the RL. A follow up CT showed multiple right pulmonary nodules with nodular areas of pleural thickening, but no new disease in the LUL. At that point, it was decided to send the patient home with no further chemotherapy and to consider harvesting the patient for an autologous stem cell transplant instead of doing the 3rd cycle of CEPP. 3) Focal consolidation in the right upper lobe with several nodular areas - most likely c/w Hodgkins Lymphoma as present since [**2140-4-7**] despite several trials of antibiotics. Since the patient was neutropenic and having fevers, a possible new pneumonia could not be ruled out. He was started on cefepime/vanco and then when he was no longer neutropenic, the cefepime was changed to levofloxacin. All of his antibiotics were then stopped when he became afebrile. The RUL consolidation persisted on follow up CT and was felt to be c/w HL. 4. Pain control- The pt has bilateral leg pain from chemotherapy. In the ICU, the pain was managed w/ short acting oxycodone because they wanted to follow his MS during the tpa infusion. Once he was transferred to the floor, he was started on oxycontin twice a day with oxycodone for breakthrough. His oxycontin was titrated upt to 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] with oxycodone for breakthrough for optimal pain control. He was discharged on this regimen. . 4. Prophylaxis- The patient was anticoagulated throughout the admission for his SVC clot. He was also maintained on colace and senna while on narcotics. . 5. Code status- Full Code . 6. [**Name (NI) **] Wife: [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 22900**] . Medications on Admission: Dacarbezine prednisone oxycodone transferred on Heparin gtt 800 units/hr</spannedText>

A repeat PET was done on [**12-8**] which showed possible new disease in the LUL and stable disease in the RL. A follow up CT showed multiple right pulmonary nodules with nodular areas of pleural thickening, but no new disease in the LUL. At that point, it was decided to send the patient home with no further chemotherapy and to consider harvesting the patient for an autologous stem cell transplant instead of doing the 3rd cycle of CEPP. 3) Focal consolidation in the right upper lobe with several nodular areas - most likely c/w Hodgkins Lymphoma as present since [**2140-4-7**] despite several trials of antibiotics. Since the patient was neutropenic and having fevers, a possible new pneumonia could not be ruled out. He was started on cefepime/vanco and then when he was no longer neutropenic, the cefepime was changed to levofloxacin. All of his antibiotics were then stopped when he became afebrile. The RUL consolidation persisted on follow up CT and was felt to be c/w HL. 4. Pain control- The pt has bilateral leg pain from chemotherapy. In the ICU, the pain was managed w/ short acting oxycodone because they wanted to follow his MS during the tpa infusion. Once he was transferred to the floor, he was started on oxycontin twice a day with oxycodone for breakthrough. His oxycontin was titrated upt to 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] with oxycodone for breakthrough for optimal pain control. He was discharged on this regimen. . 4. Prophylaxis- The patient was anticoagulated throughout the admission for his SVC clot. He was also maintained on colace and senna while on narcotics. . 5. Code status- Full Code . 6. [**Name (NI) **] Wife: [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 22900**] . Medications on Admission: Dacarbezine prednisone oxycodone transferred on Heparin gtt 800 units/hr</mentionClass>
