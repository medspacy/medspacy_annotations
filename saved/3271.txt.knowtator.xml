        <spannedText>HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 71 year old, woman with hypertension, high cholesterol, thoracic abdominal aortic repair times two. The patient has also been unable to do her activities of daily living, due to generalized weakness that started suddenly at the time of her second thoracic aneurysm repair. On [**6-14**], she was in her usual state of health when she was noted by her family to be asleep in her chair and slumped to the right at 6 p.m. They tried to wake her a couple of hours later. She mumbled a few words and went back to sleep. Then at 10 p.m., they again tried to arouse her and had difficulty. She could not answer a few simple questions after much prodding and could not open her eyes. They noticed that she had a left facial droop and her left side was weak but she was able to grip her hands on either side. She was brought to [**Hospital 882**] hospital via ambulance with a head CT revealed a right thalamic hemorrhage. She was agitated and received 1 mg of Ativan, after which she became much more lethargic. Her blood pressure was erratic, ranging from 83 to 54 to 183/141. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for further treatment. The patient was then transferred to Neurologic Intensive Care Unit for further management of her hypertensive hemorrhagic stroke. Magnetic resonance scan of the head revealed right thalamic hemorrhage confirmed by CT, measuring 1.2 by 1.3 by 1.5 cms. Imaging studies showed midline shift or ventricular extension. The patient's blood pressure was vigorously controlled in the neurologic Intensive Care Unit with Labetalol and betablockers. The patient had labile blood pressures in the neurologic Intensive Care Unit for a two to three day course but systolic pressures were maintained between 120 and 140. The patient was also treated with Levofloxacin for urinary tract infection on urinalysis. The patient stabilized in neurologic Intensive Care Unit and was transferred to the floor for further blood pressure management and disposition. The patient's blood pressure was controlled on medication of Labetalol. An ace inhibitor was not added to the pharmacologic regimen. The patient was then stabilized on beta-blocker and had appropriate physical therapy, speech therapy and occupational therapy screens. The patient was deemed not to be able to swallow autonomously and had percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placed one day prior to discharge. The patient finished course of antibiotics for urinary tract infection with repeat head CT later on admission showing unchanging right thalamic hemorrhage. On physical examination the patient had blood pressure of 98/60 to 190/120 on admission, which was very labile, but then stabilized throughout admission. Pulse was between 70 and 90. Respiratory rate of 13. The patient was afebrile on admission. Throughout admission, the patient was somnolent on general examination with decreased arousability. The patient had a supple neck with normal S1 and S2, 2/6 systolic murmur. Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen was soft and extremities had no edema with distal pulses intact with no rashes. On neurologic examination, the patient was only arousable to noxious stimuli on left side and right side on admission, with improvement in alertness and arousability prior to discharge. The patient was able to follow simple commands on the right side, with severe left neglect. The patient was dysarthric with sparse output. She will say name and simple phrases in response to questioning. The patient's ability to follow commands improved and she was able to perform simple commands prior to discharge. The patient also had a right gaze deviation and a dense left hemiparesis on neurologic examination, with arm greater than leg. The patient was unable to tract extraocular movements past the midline and unable to withdraw from painful stimulus on the left arm. On motor examination, the patient had increased tone on the left with 4+/5 right hand grasp, triceps with the left [**1-6**] grasp; positive pronator drift on the left with difficulty assessing lower extremities as the patient could not cooperate with the examination. On cranial nerve examination, the patient had left facial droop with, as mentioned, a right gaze deviation and difficulty crossing midline. The patient was unable to cooperative with coordination examination or gait examination.</spannedText>

        <spannedText>LABORATORY DATA: The patient had a video swallow study on [**6-21**] which showed no evidence of aspiration or penetration of vocal cords, with a delay in volitional swallow, with trouble initiating. Due to trouble initiating, the patient had gastric tube placed on [**2100-6-25**] to augment nutrition with successful G tube passage of food and liquid. On [**6-20**], the patient also had CT of the head without contrast for follow-up which showed no mass effect or shift of normal midline structures. There was note made of moderate vascular ectasia and neural calcifications, likely related to atherosclerosis with unchanged right thalamic hemorrhage size. The patient also had electrolytes and CBC monitored very closely during admission for supplementation and supportive care. The patient did spike white blood cell count during urinary tract infection which was diagnosed early in admission but white count subsided prior to discharge. The patient was also afebrile prior to discharge.</spannedText>

        <spannedText>HOSPITAL COURSE: As mentioned, the patient was transferred to neuro-medicine where gastrointestinal consult inserted a gastric tube for p.o. augmentation nutrition. Decision to place G tube was discussed with the patient's family who desired the patient to have supplemental nutrition until the patient could successfully eat on her own and initiate swallowing as an outpatient. The patient will now be transfer to the rehabilitation facility for strengthening of left sided hemiparesis and rehabilitation of dysarthria and swallowing. According to the patient's primary medical doctor, the patient has a baseline functional status of decreased arousability and decreased cognition at baseline. These finding are suggestive of a neurodegenerative process such as dementia of Alzheimer's type.</spannedText>
