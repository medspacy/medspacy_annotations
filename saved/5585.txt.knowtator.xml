The patient has had previous episodes of left arm weakness lasting several minutes. The first onset was [**2125-6-26**]. At that time she was seen by her primary care physician and begun on aspirin. Her statin dosing was increased and she was referred for carotid ultrasound and an echocardiogram. Patient had a repeat episode on [**2125-7-13**] and was encouraged to come to the emergency room but did not. The patient had a third episode on the night of admission. The patient had pain, weakness and paresthesias of the left face, upper and lower extremities with residual diminished sensation. The patient denies dyspnea, visual changes, loss of consciousness, aphasia, hematuria, dysuria, neck pain. Patient was initially evaluated in the emergency room and had an electrocardiogram, a head CT and vascular was consulted. Patient was begun on IV heparin drip at 1,000 units per hour and the coagulations were monitored. She is now admitted to the vascular service for definitive treatment.</spannedText>

She has moderate pulmonary hypertension. A PMIBI done on [**2125-1-30**] was negative for ischemic. A head CT done was without hemorrhage or acute process. White count was 9.0, hematocrit 35.2, platelets 213,000. BUN 51, creatinine 3.0. Urine electrolytes were creatinine 33, sodium 99, potassium 11. [**Doctor Last Name **] was 6.25. CK MB, troponins 192, 4 and less than 0.1. Electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm, left ventricular hypertrophy. The patient was maintained n.p.o. Electrolytes were repleted. Her blood pressure was controlled with metoprolol. Goal blood pressure 120s to 140s. Patient was continued on heparin drip. Neurology was consulted. The neurologic examination - mental status - the patient is clear, awake, pleasant but slightly blunted affect. She is oriented to person, place, time and president. She has good attention span. She is able to recall in 10 seconds. Her language is fluent with good comprehension, repetition. Naming and [**Location (un) 1131**] intact. No dysarthria. There was no apraxia, agnosia, no neglect. Able to calculate. No left to right mismatch. Registration is 3 out 3. Object recall is 3 out 3 objects after three minutes. Cranial nerves are intact. Sensory is normal touch, proprioception and pinprick are normal. There is decreased vibration at the toes. No extinction to double stimulus. Motor: There is wasting of the thenar muscles on the left and bilateral EDBs. Increased leg tone is mild. There is no fasciculations or drift. There is no adventitious movements or asterixis. Strength is [**4-5**] on the right. The toe is [**3-6**]. On the left the deltoids are [**3-6**]. Triceps [**3-6**]. Biceps are [**4-5**]. Hamstrings are [**3-6**]. DF and PFs are [**4-5**].

The patellar is 2+. The arch is 0 and the toes are downward. Normal finger to nose and heel to shin and RAMs. Feet slight antalgic gait, unable to tandem, no Romberg. Impression: This patient with multiple vascular risk factors with two transient episodes of left sided weakness and right internal carotid artery occlusion on an outpatient basis. Patient has subtle peripheral polyneuropathy which is probably secondary to diabetes or her vitamin B12 deficiency. Stroke is high on the differential considering her symptoms. Recommendations: MRI. Auto brachial latent blood pressure. Telemetry overnight to rule out dysrhythmias. Consider a transesophageal echocardiogram since the transthoracic echocardiogram was normal. They also recommended the patient be encouraged to follow up with the neurology clinic for evaluation of her peripheral neuropathy versus radiculopathy. An MRI of the brain was obtained which was negative for acute infarct and an MRI of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] demonstrates flow in the major branch of circulation. The study is collaborative to the ultrasound which demonstrates a 70 to 79% right internal carotid artery stenosis and a left internal carotid artery stenosis without stenosis. There is antegrade vertebral flow bilaterally. Patient underwent a right carotid endarterectomy without incident on [**2125-7-18**]. During her hospitalization she was followed by the renal service for her chronic renal insufficiencies. They felt the patient's renal insufficiency was related to diabetic nephropathy and hypertension, question renal vascular hypertension as well. Recommended a urine protein-creatinine ratio which was sent at the time of dictation, an MRA which was scheduled at the time of dictation. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] recommended changing the beta blockade from atenolol to Toprol. Would considering adding [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] but after discussing with him this will be done on follow up. Patient's postoperative course was unremarkable. At the time of discharge the patient was neurologically stable. Renal function was stable. She was discharged to home. She should follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in three weeks time. She should follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the renal service. Post discharge she should call for an appointment. Aspirin 81 mg q day was started. The patient was instructed to call us should the headache not relieve with Tylenol. She should not drive until seen in follow up. She may otherwise take a shower. She should continue her medications as directed. The patient should call for her renal appointment at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 60**].</spannedText>
