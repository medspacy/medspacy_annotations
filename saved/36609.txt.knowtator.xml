        <spannedText>Assessment and Plan: This is a 19 year old with no PMH transfer from [**Hospital1 1474**] with bilateral PE's. . # Massive Pulmonary Embolism: patient was noted to have syncopal episode while at the gym yesterday, and was taken to [**Hospital 1474**] hospital where she was found to have b/l PEs. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] and initially was admitted to the MICU. Pt did have evidence of right heart strain on both transthoracic echocardiogram and by EKG. Pt remained hemodynamically stable and the decision was made against lysis with TPA. Pt was therefore transferred to the floor several hours later. Bilateral lower extremity ultrasounds did not show evidence of DVT. Pt was anticoagulated with heparin gtt throughout her stay and was bridged to coumadin with 48 hours of overlap (when both her INR and PTT were therapeutic). She was discharged on coumadin. . Pt's only risk factors for PE are FH of clotting and oral contraceptives. Pt did not take her contraceptives while in the hospital and was advised to not take oral contraceptives in the future. She was also advised to discuss all future contraceptive decisions (aside from condoms) with her hematologist as other hormonal contraceptives can also carry an increased risk of clotting. Pt will follow up with with her primary care doctor (who will follow her INR) and hematologist. . #S/P FALL: Pt had syncopal episode at gym without hitting her head. She did have swelling and pain in her right third finger which was found to have a non-displaced avulsion fracture. Plastic surgery saw her and gave her a brace for the finger. She will follow-up in hand clinic. .</spannedText>

        <spannedText>You were admitted to [**Hospital1 **] Hospital because of several clots in the arteries that go to your lungs (pulmonary arteries). We looked at your heart with ultrasound (called an echocardiogram) and monitored your heart rate while you were here; both the echocardiogram and your heart rate made us think that your heart is having to work harder than usual to pump blood through your lung arteries. This means that when you go home you need to be very calm, walk slowly, not exercise or lift heavy things, and not go to work until either your primary care doctor or your hematologist says that you are well enough to do those things. You were started on several medicines (heparin and coumadin) which help to prevent the clots from growing. At this point, the coumadin levels are high enough to prevent further clotting without the heparin (which you can only get in the hospital), so we are sending you home on the coumadin alone. You should take 4mg of coumadin every day in the evening until you see your doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 2974**]. He will check your coumadin level (called an INR) and then he may increase or decrease your dose based on the blood test. Make sure you discuss your INR and your coumadin dose before you leave his office on [**Last Name (Titles) 2974**]. If your INR is not back by the time you leave his office, please make sure you know what time to call the office to find out what your coumadin dose should be. They should also be able to tell you when your next blood test will be (probably sometime next week). Please return to the hospital for fainting or shortness of breath. Please call your doctor or return to the hospital for chest pain or lightheadedness or any other symptoms which are concerning to you.</spannedText>
