        <spannedText>HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS INCLUDING PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA: 1. Respiratory: [**Known lastname 14552**] had worsening grunting, flaring, and retracting. She was initially on nasal cannula O2, but was transitioned to continuous positive airway pressure. She continued to require 50-60% oxygen and with her increased work of breathing, was electively intubated and received 2 doses of surfactant. She self-extubated on day of life #3. She had increasing respiratory distress and was found to have a left pneumothorax on chest x-ray. This was treated with thoracentesis and eventual chest tube placement. By day of life #5, she had weaned to nasal cannula O2. The chest tube was removed on [**2150-8-27**]. She transitioned to room air on day of life #7 and continued in room air through the rest of her neonatal intensive care unit admission. Chest x-rays were consistent with surfactant deficiency. At the time of discharge, she was breathing comfortably in room air with a respiratory rate of 30-60 breaths per minute. 1. Cardiovascular: [**Known lastname 14552**] has maintained normal heart rates and blood pressures. A murmur was noted on day of life #2. An electrocardiogram was obtained and was within normal limits. [**Known lastname 14552**] was evaluated by the cardiology consult team from [**Hospital3 1810**]. They recommend followup 1 month after discharge. An echocardiogram was not felt to be indicated. At the time of discharge, the murmur remained audible at the left sternal border. Baseline heart rate is 130-150 beats per minute. Recent blood pressure was 79/44 with a mean of 53. 1. Fluid, electrolytes, and nutrition: [**Known lastname 14552**] was initially NPO and maintained on intravenous fluids. Enteral feeds were started on day of life #4 and gradually advanced to full volume. At the time of discharge, she is ad-lib p.o. feeding Enfamil 24 calories per ounce. Weight on the day of discharge is 2.7 kilograms. Serum electrolytes were checked on the 1st week of life and were within normal limits. 1. Infectious disease: Due to the unknown etiology of the respiratory distress, [**Known lastname 14552**] was evaluated for sepsis. A complete blood count drawn upon admission to the neonatal intensive care unit was within normal limits. A blood culture was obtained prior to starting intravenous antibiotics. The blood culture was no growth at 48 hours and the antibiotics were discontinued. 1. Hematological: Hematocrit at birth was 48.6%. [**Known lastname 14552**] did not receive any transfusions of blood products. 1. Gastrointestinal: [**Known lastname 14552**] required treatment for unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia with phototherapy. Peak serum bilirubin occurred on day of life #4, total of 13.6/0.3 mg per deciliter direct. She was treated with phototherapy for approximately 3 days. Rebound bilirubin on [**2150-8-30**] was 10.7/0.5 mg per deciliter direct. 1. Neurological: [**Known lastname 14552**] has maintained a normal neurological exam, and there were no neurological concerns at the time of discharge. 1. Sensory: Audiology. Hearing screening was performed with automated auditory brainstem responses. [**Known lastname 14552**] passed in both ears.</spannedText>

        <spannedText>CARE AND RECOMMENDATIONS AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE: 1. Feeding: Ad-lib p.o. feeding Enfamil 24 calories per ounce. 2. No medications. 3. Car seat position screening was performed. [**Known lastname 14552**] was observed in her car seat for 90 minutes without any episodes of oxygen desaturation or bradycardia. 4. State newborn screen initially was sent on day of life #3. The 170-H-P were elevated. A repeat screen was sent on [**2150-9-2**] and the results remain pending at the time of discharge. 5. Immunizations received. Hepatitis B vaccine was administered on [**2150-9-2**]. 6. Immediate recommended: Synagis RSV prophylaxis should be considered from [**Month (only) **] through [**Month (only) 958**] for infants who meet any of the following 3 criteria: 1. Born at less than 32 weeks; 2. Born between 32 and 35 weeks with 2 of the following: Daycare during the RSV season, a smoker in the household, neuromuscular disease, airway abnormalities, or school-age siblings; or 3. With chronic lung disease. 7. The patient was born in breech position. In accordance with AAP guidelines, a hip ultraosund is suggested during early infancy. Influenza immunization is recommended annually in the fall for all infants once they reach 6 months of age. Before this age and for the first 24 months of the child's life, immunization against influenza is recommended for household contacts and out-of-home caregivers.</spannedText>
