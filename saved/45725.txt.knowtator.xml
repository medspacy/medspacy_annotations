        <spannedText>The patient is a 78-year-old woman who was found unresponsive and went into respiratory distress. As part of her workup, she had a head CT showing evidence of a possible right anterior cerebral artery stroke. She was intubated on arrival to the Emergency Room. She was admitted to the Neurointensive Care Unit. Initially, her blood pressure was allowed to autoregulate. She eventually was started on a labetalol drip for her blood pressure. She had episodes of seizures during admission treated with Ativan. She reverted on Dilantin. She was transfused to keep her hematocrit elevated. She was started on levofloxacin for pneumonia. She continued to have fevers initially. She was on anticoagulation for prosthetic heart valve. Over time, she continued to have leukocytosis and fever. She was started on vancomycin which was then discontinued after no significant improvement in her care. They decided to make her DNR/DNI. The patient began to have movement of the right side spontaneously, however, she continued to have decerebrate-like posturing on the left. Eventually, she was successfully extubated and she was discharged to home with hospice care.</spannedText>
