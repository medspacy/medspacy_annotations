        <spannedText>The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis QMWF, hepatitis C, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes, who was recently admitted to the [**Hospital6 256**] in [**2154-2-16**] with a question of cellulitis versus an allergy related to his newly revised AV fistula. Recently, the patient had begun to feel slightly out of the ordinary about a week prior to presentation with some fatigue and lethargy initially without any cough, fever, or chills. Subsequently, the patient developed some back and chest soreness with achiness in the right chest with radiation to the back. The patient did not go to his scheduled hemodialysis on Friday because he did not feel well. Instead, he went to the [**Hospital3 **] Emergency Department where he had a CT and chest x-ray where he was diagnosed with osteoarthritis and discharged. The patient then went to hemodialysis the subsequent day. He had a temperature of 102 that night. Again, the patient presented to the [**Hospital3 **] Emergency Room where he had a chest x-ray showing pneumonia. At that point, the patient preferred admission to the [**Hospital6 2018**] and presented to the Emergency Room on the same night. At this time, the initial read of his chest x-ray showed no evidence of pneumonia and the patient was sent home with the diagnosis of costochondritis. Since this time, which was on [**2154-4-21**], the patient has had increasing lethargy and awoke confused and febrile to 102, at which time again he was brought back to [**Hospital6 256**].</spannedText>

        <spannedText>1. PULMONARY: The patient initially was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit given his profound hypoxia with a saturation of 66% on room air and his chest x-ray which showed rapid development within one day of what was initially read as a small questionable left lower lobe infiltrate on [**2154-4-21**] and a chest x-ray on [**2154-4-22**] with diffuse right-sided consolidation as well as left upper lobe infiltrate. The patient was started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin. He persistently had a dry cough without any sputum. The patient was initially on a 50% face mask at which time he desaturated to the high 90s. He was changed to a nonrebreather. Subsequently, on nonrebreather he had an ABG of 7.42, 41, 77. The patient was then weaned off oxygen from face mask to nasal cannula and had a requirement of approximately 5-6 liters of oxygen. At this time, he was transferred to the medical floor where he was rapidly weaned to a saturation of 92% on room air. The patient was continued on a total of a five day course of azithromycin as well as a five day course of IV ceftriaxone which was then changed to cefpodoxime/ proxetil at 400 mg p.o. q.d. for an additional nine days to complete a total of a 14 day course. The patient had a repeat chest x-ray on [**2154-4-25**] that showed complete resolution of all of his prior infiltrates. The patient also had significant improvement in his lung examination. 2. HYPERTENSION: The patient was maintained on his home dose antihypertensive regimen with some initial holding of his Lopressor in the Intensive Care Unit which was subsequently restarted on the floor secondary to his elevated blood pressures. 3. RENAL FAILURE: The patient was continued on his usual regimen of hemodialysis. Given his hyperphosphatemia, the patient was increased from 800 mg of Sevelamer p.o. t.i.d. with meals to 1,600 mg p.o. t.i.d. with meals. 4. RIGHT FOOT ULCER: Initially this was stable with no signs of fluctuants or infection. The patient was seen by the Podiatry Service and according to Podiatry recommendations the patient was treated with b.i.d. to t.i.d. wet-to-dry dressing changes as well as antibiotic ointment intermittently. The patient had his wounds debrided by his attending physician on one to two occasions. The patient continued to have subsequent limitation in his mobility secondary to deconditioning as well as his right foot ulcer. The patient was seen by the Physical Therapy Service and recommendations for transfer to a [**Hospital 3058**] rehabilitation facility were made. 5. DIABETES MELLITUS: The patient was continued on his home dose antidiabetic regimen with NPH and sliding scale insulin with good glycemic control. 6. DISPOSITION: The patient continued to have improvement from his initial pneumonia; however, he was still hypoxic to 92% on room air. In addition, the patient was significantly deconditioned and fatigued, likely secondary to his dialysis as well. The patient's right foot ulcer also limited his mobility. The patient will be transferred to the [**Hospital 38**] Rehabilitation Facility on [**2154-4-27**]. The patient was also seen by the Social Work Transplant Center who met with the patient's wife as well.</spannedText>

Given his hyperphosphatemia, the patient was increased from 800 mg of Sevelamer p.o. t.i.d. with meals to 1,600 mg p.o. t.i.d. with meals. 4. RIGHT FOOT ULCER: Initially this was stable with no signs of fluctuants or infection. The patient was seen by the Podiatry Service and according to Podiatry recommendations the patient was treated with b.i.d. to t.i.d. wet-to-dry dressing changes as well as antibiotic ointment intermittently. The patient had his wounds debrided by his attending physician on one to two occasions. The patient continued to have subsequent limitation in his mobility secondary to deconditioning as well as his right foot ulcer. The patient was seen by the Physical Therapy Service and recommendations for transfer to a [**Hospital 3058**] rehabilitation facility were made. 5. DIABETES MELLITUS: The patient was continued on his home dose antidiabetic regimen with NPH and sliding scale insulin with good glycemic control. 6. DISPOSITION: The patient continued to have improvement from his initial pneumonia; however, he was still hypoxic to 92% on room air. In addition, the patient was significantly deconditioned and fatigued, likely secondary to his dialysis as well. The patient's right foot ulcer also limited his mobility. The patient will be transferred to the [**Hospital 38**] Rehabilitation Facility on [**2154-4-27**]. The patient was also seen by the Social Work Transplant Center who met with the patient's wife as well.</mentionClass>
