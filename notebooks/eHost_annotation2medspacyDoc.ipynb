Call for concern of aspiration pneumonia. She also had an elevated white count with evidence of bandemia. On [**2180-9-29**] she also developed a decreased urine output in the setting of febrile illness, and there was concern for sepsis. Her urine output continued to climb despite fluid boluses. Her volume status was unclear but most likely representative of total body fluid overload with decreased intervascular volume, and plans were made for placement of a PA catheter. Despite concern for sepsis, her mental status continued to improve from the time of admission. However, the house officers called on [**2180-9-29**] in the afternoon due to decreased mental status, tachypnea, bradycardia, and hypotension. Passed away on [**2180-9-29**] at 15:50.
