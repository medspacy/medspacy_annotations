History of Present Illness:
61 M with h/o ESRD on HD, Etoh cirrhosis, hep B and hep C,
seizure d/o, gout, HTN, line infections, recently d/c'd after
admit for 1 week history of diarrhea, now readmitted from HD for
hypotension, continued diarrhea. Prior to last admit, pt had 1
week of yellow watery stool, non-bloody, non-black, occuring
about six times/day, worse at night.  At that time, he denied
nausea/vomiting, fever, chills, abdominal pain, chest pain, or
SOB, hematemesis, recent laxatives or antibiotics.  C.diff was
sent from the NH was negative.  He did note progressive leg
weakness over several months, and RN at the NH reported
progressive mental status decline since [**10-6**], with lethargy,
psychomotor retardation and confusion. During recent admit,
patient had a CT of the abdomen that showed thickening of the
ascending and transverse colon c/w colitis.  Stool cultures
including ova + parasites, and C.diff were sent which came back
negative.  He was transiently on Levo/Flagyl but these were
discontinued after negative stool culture.  By HD#4, he was
forming more formed stool, and in fact his stool became too hard
and so he was re-started on a stool softener colace. It was felt
that he likely had a viral enterocolitis, or less likely, an
ischemic colitis from possible hypotensive episode during HD
session. Another possibility was a viral enteritis causing
hypovolemia, then the resulting hypotension causing ischemic
colitis.  New acute onset of inflammatory bowel disease was
thought very unlikely. Patient was not felt to warrant a
colonoscopy at the time, as he improved on conservative
management.
.
Since his discharge [**2144-6-8**], 4d PTA, the patient has had
recurrence of his diarrhea, which he says only seemed to slow
down somewhat but never went away. He is not clear what
medicines he has been getting at [**Hospital1 11851**], including if he has
gotten any laxatives or stool softeners. He has been on a BRAT
diet, so presumably they have held his laxatives as well.
.
Patient was at HD today, with initial BP 134/74, which fell to
84/40. 300cc of NS was given, which brought up the BP to 92/60,
but then it fell to 71/45. Pt had 2.5h of HD, stopped early.
Received a total of 2100cc NS, and even with this and in T-[**Doctor Last Name **]
SBP remained in 80s. Denied CP, SOB. When EMS arrived, BP 115/80
sitting and 96/64 lying flat. Was admitted for dehydration from
continued diarrhea. BP in ED ranged 107-119/56-77, HR ranged
58-70.

Reports:
[**2144-6-12**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP)AP UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE
CHEST: A central line is unchanged, terminating at the
aortocaval junction. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are
stable. A right-sided pleural effusion with associated
atelectasis is again demonstrated and not significantly changed
compared to the prior study. No evidence of pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: No significant interval change compared to the
radiograph of [**2144-6-3**].
.
[**2144-6-12**] Radiology CT ABDOMEN PELVIS:
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: A right-sided pleural
effusion and bilateral lower lobe multifocal patchy opacities
are again demonstrated not significantly changed compared to the
prior study. The liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, stomach,
and adrenal glands are unremarkable. The kidneys are atrophic.
Enhancement of the renal parenchyma is noted. There is wall
edema/thickening of the ascending colon. There is apparent wall
thickening of the transverse colon as well that was also
demonstrated on the prior study. The splenic flexure and
descending colon is under-filled, however there also appears to
be wall edema affecting these locations as well. Note is made of
free fluid tracking along the pericolic gutters, increased
compared to the prior study. The appendix appears less enlarged
compared to the prior study. The small bowel is grossly
unremarkable and of normal caliber. There are no pathologically
enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST
IMPRESSION: 1. Unchanged appearance of the chest compared to the
prior study with a right-sided pleural effusion and patchy
multifocal opacities.
2. Wall edema/thickening of the ascending and transverse colon
and possibly descending colon consistent with colitis with
interval increase in free fluid tracking along the pericolic
gutters. Differential diagnosis includes infectious,
inflammatory, and ischemic etiologies.
.
[**2144-6-14**] Port Chest: 1) Persistent small curvilinear opacity at
the left apex, which may reflect a small pneumothorax.
2) Stable moderate to large partially loculated right pleural
effusion with adjacent opacities in the right middle and lower
lobes.
.
[**2144-6-18**] Port Chest: Persisting moderate right-sided pleural
effusion with progression of associated consolidation, which
given the clinical history is likely consistent with pneumonia.
No other significant interval change.
.
[**2144-7-6**]: Left UE US- Partially occlusive thrombus in the left
internal jugular vein. Possible partially occlusive thrombus in
the left basilic vein along the PICC.
.
[**2144-7-8**]: Portable Abdomen: 1. No free air. 2. Ill-defined
nodular density at the left lung base, likely infectious or
inflammatory in etiology given that it was not present on the
recent prior exam. Followup recommended.

[**2144-7-13**]: Port Chest: 1.  Stable position of left internal
jugular venous access catheter.  A right- sided PICC has been
removed. 2.  Increase in the patchy opacities at the left base.
Stable opacity at the right base.  Findings could be consistent
with aspiration. 3.  Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater
than left.
.
[**2144-7-14**]: pORT CHEST: IMPRESSION:  No short interval change.  No
pneumonia or overt fluid overload.


Brief Hospital Course:
1)Hypotension/Sepsis: Pt has low baseline bp, likely related to
his ESLD.  A day after the sigmoidoscopy, he underwent HD where
he was afebrile and stable, and was transported to the GI suite
for possible colonoscopy but developed severe rigor and fever.
He was hypotensive to 40-90's fluctuating.  Dopamine was started
on the floor in addition to fluid boluses, and pt was
transferred to the MICU.  BCx grew E.Coli resistant to
quinolones.  He was initially on Ceftriaxone and Vancomycin but
was tailored to Ceftriaxone.  He was later transferred to the
floor where his BP was stable at SBP 90-110's.  He also has
adrenal insufficiency from long term use of prednsione for gout.
 So he received stress dose steroids of fludrocortisone and
hydrocortisone since the hypotensive espisode.  He was treated
with ceftriaxone for the E.Coli sepsis.  The source was thought
to be either from sigmoidiscopy or line related as he had
femoral line in his right groin as well as tunneled HD line in
his left IJ.  After temporary HD line was placed in the left
groin, both of the old lines were removed.  Serial surveillance
cultures have been negative. Plan at this point was to place a
tunneled HD catheter by IR. Placement of this catheter was
complicated by the fact that patient was having mental status
change and did not have a health care proxy. After discussion
with ethics, it was thought that placement of these catheters
was medically necessary and both a tunneled Left HD catheter and
left PICC line were placed. The left groin catheter was removed
at this point. On [**2144-6-28**], the patient was noted to have a brief
desaturation on the floor down to about 89% on room air, which
increased to 98-99% with non-rebreather. The patient was then
successfully weaned down to low-flow nasal canula. At this
point, the patient had completed ceftriaxone for his previous E.
Coli bactermiea, but was already receiving Flagyl for a possible
previous aspiration. Blood cultures were sent. The patient was
noted the day following to have a leukocytosis, which was also
accompanied by abdominal pain. A [**Name (NI) 5283**] sono was negative and a
port chest and KUB did not demonstrate any evidence of disease
including free air. In the setting of this leukocytosis, the
patient again became hypotensive and was empirically started on
Vancomycin IV and Zosyn. Additionally, C. Diff toxin was sent
which was positive depite having received 9+ days of Flagyl. The
patient was additioanlly started on PO Vancomycin and the Flagyl
was discontinued. The patient, who previously had been weaned
back down to 10mg PO qd of prednisone was again brought to his
stress dose steroid of 100mg hydrocortisone qd for possible
adrenal insufficiency. The patient was additionally given 1 unit
PRBC for low Hct. In the setting of continued GI output, the
patient additionally had a rectal tube placed on [**2144-7-5**] to
avoid contamination of his sacral decubitus ulcer. On [**2144-7-6**],
patient's left arm was noted to be particularly swollen. A LUE
US revealed partial obstruction of the left IJ and Left basilic
vein. The patient's PICC was pulled and the patient was started
on an IV Heparin drip. The patient was scheduled to have an
additional PICC placed the following day. THat evening, the
patient was noted to have some epistaxis without hemodynamic
compromise and the Heparin Drip was immediatley stopped. The
patient was given 1 unit of blood overnight. The patient was
fairly stable on the floor with SBP 100-110 with plans of
possible discharge back to nursing facility, as this was what
patient repeatedly told medical team he wished to do. On the
morning of [**2143-7-14**], the patient was seen in the a.m. and found
to be disoriented, confused and audibly gurgling. The patient
was ordered for a portable chest film, but was with satisfactory
O2 sats on NC. While in HD, team was called as patient had
acutely decompensated since his arrival. He was with mental
deteriation and O2 sats to the high 70's and 80's. The patient
was placed on a non-rebreather, an ABG and stat port film were
performed and the MICU team was called to evaluate the patient.
As the patient was DNR/DNI it was determined that the patient
may recieve pressors if necessary in the unit, but at most could
receive bi-PAP or CPAP for ventilatory support. Through the
course of the day the patient was attempted to be weaned back to
NC 5-6L, which failed. The patient was placed back on 100% O2 on
non-rebreather, but was maintaining BP 90-110 without pressors.
In the few days prior to these desaturations the patient was
additionally becoming frequently hypoglycemic. The patient was
not receiving insulin, and was given amps of dextrose as needed
for hypoglycemic episodes as well as basal fluids with D5.
Overnight, the patient was seen by the nightteam, with similar
report of O2 desat and gurgling. Upon suction, frank blood was
suctioned through a nasal trach tube. The patient was
immediately given 1 unit of platelets for hrombocytopenia and
the patient previously that evening had received i unit of FFP
for an elevated INR. AM labs revealed that the patient had
25bands and was currently unweanable from 100% non-rebreather.
- [**2144-7-15**] Prior conversations with the patient when he was
lucid revealed that the patient was willing to continue
hemodialysis, but only if he was able to go back to his
retirement home for treatment. The patient reported clearly to
the medical team he did not want to stay in the hospital
indefinitely on hemodialysis and he did not want to die in the
hospital, with his life being prolonged on hemodialysis. The
patient had reported he wished to be DNR/DNI and did not want
his estranged family involved in his care. At the time of the
most recent events above, the medical team including all
particpiating physicians, nurses, and case manager discussed the
case and what they thought the patient would have wanted given
his condition, his poor prognosis, and poor chance of ever going
back to retirement home with a qulaity of life he would have
wanted. Given the above and his recent medical decompensation,
thought likely to represent sepsis and DIC, the decision was
made, agreed upon by all healthcare workers involed in his care,
that Mr. [**Known lastname 52065**] would not have wanted continued aggressive
medical management. The decision was made to place the patient
on comfort care, and all medical treatments including blood
draws and HD were stopped. On [**2144-7-15**] the patient was placed on
a morphine drip titrated to comfort. On the morning of [**2144-7-16**],
the patient was noted to be demonstrating an agonal breathing
pattern. The patient quitely passed away within a few hours
without incident.

1)Colitis: The patient was recently admitted for the same
symptoms.  On last admission, all stool studies were negative
and his diarrhea slowly resolved.  He presented again with
persistent diarrhea.  CT of the abdomen showing wall thickening
of the ascending, transverse, and descending colon.  Again, all
of the stool studies were negative including C.diff toxin A and
B upon admission.  He underwent sigmoidoscopy which showed
multiple patchy erythematous and edematous area but etiology was
inconclusive.  The plan was to send him for colonoscopy but
patient became septic with E. Coli bactermiea s/p sigmoidoscopy
for which he was treated with ceftriaxone. After resolution of
his septic episode, the patient continued to have diarrhea
during his hospital stay, accompanied as well by abdominal pain.
Despite additional treatment with Flagyl, which had been started
for a likely aspiration PNA, the patient's C. diff toxin A
became positive on [**2144-7-1**]. The patient was additionally started
on PO Vancomycin at this time 125mg po q6h for treatment of
likely C. Diff Colitis. The patient was additionally given
questrum 4 gm PO QID to help solidify his bowel movements. The
patient was additionally found during his stay to have frequent
contamination of his sacral decubitus ulcer with feces. Because
of this, a rectal tube was placed while the patient experienced
diarrhea to avoid contamination of his open wound. Over the
course of about a week, the patient's bowel movements became
less freqient and better formed. The patient was with resolution
of his diarrhea, without a rectal tube, and had his questrum
dosing decreased to tid until the events as noted above.
.
3)Pneumonia: CXR in MICU suggestive of possible PNA as well as
worsening right side pleural effusion which was tapped.  The
pleural fluid was consistent with exudate by Light's criteria
and is likely parapneumonic.  He likely had aspiration pneumonia
in the ICU while his mental status was altered.  Flagyl was
added in addition to Ceftriaxone to cover for anerobes for
pneumonia as well as empiric coverage for GI flora. Remainder of
hospital course is as noted above
.
4)Thrombocytopenia: He has a baseline thrombocytopenia from
chronic liver disease.  However, he had a drop in plt count to
the 40's.  HIT antibody was sent which came back positive.
Repeat HIT was negative as was Serotonin Release Assay.
.
5)Mental Status: progressively declining mental status since
last [**Month (only) 359**]; unclear etiology.  He became more confused and
disoriented after the MICU stay which was thoguht to be ICU
psychosis and toxic-metabolic picture.  Remainder of hospital
course as above
.
6)Social: Pt has no family member to contact and no health care
proxy.  His only contact of record is a friend/neighbor.  Ethics
consult was otained to define a long term care as he is clearly
DNR/DNI.  Also he may need a legal guardianship. Remainder of
hospital course is as above.

7)Nutrition: Pt with albumin of 1.8 primarily from persistent
diarrhea and decreased po intake from inumerous NPO
peri-procedure and ICU stay. Paient was started and weaner from
TPN during stay. remainder of hospital course as above

8)Gout: Pt with long standing use of prednisone 10 mg qd for
chronic gout.  This was discouraged by Rheumatology back in
[**2143-10-4**] but has not been tapered.

9)Hypothyroid: His synthroid dose was just increased to 50 mcg
qd on last admission. Was continued during stay.

10)CODE: DNR/DNI-well documented. [**Hospital **] hospital course as
above, deceased on [**2144-7-16**]
