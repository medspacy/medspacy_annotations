Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred via ambulance from [**Hospital3 **] left main and three vessel disease with active chest
pain, ruling in for a myocardial infarction.  He continued to
have intractable chest pain and was brought emergently to the
operating room.  There he underwent emergent coronary artery
bypass grafting.  Please see the operative note for details.  In
summary, he arrested with induction and CPR was performed while
he was placed on bypass.  He tolerated the operation poorly and
returned to the cardiac surgery intensive care unit in
electro-mechanical dissociation.  Despite heroic measures he was
pronounced at 7:05AM.
