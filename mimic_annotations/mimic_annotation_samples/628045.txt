   now presents with hypoxia. Per documentation, patient had uneventful
   hospital course except for hypertension for which she was transiently
   on clonidine and now on norvasc, and fluid retention for which she was
   placed on lasix 40 [**Hospital1 **] and just transitioned to lasix 20 daily
   yesterday. At rehab today patient was noted to be hypoxic to 70s on RA.
   EMS was called and she was noted to be saturating in low 80s on RA. She
   was started on 5L and improved to 93% and transferrred to [**Hospital1 1**].
   .
   Patient feels generally well, but noticed some mild SOB at rest this

   unremarkable. CXR showed bilateraly effusions, with a small
   consolidation on the right. CTA was negative for PE, but did show large
   effusions. On the way back from CT, patient desaturated to low 90s on
   5L NC. She received 40 mg of Lasix IV and put out 1.5 L. She was placed
   on a NRB and saturations improved to the mid 90s. She received
   Ceftriaxone 1 g IVx1, Azithromycin 500 mg IV x1, and tylenol. On
   transfer, VS were 86, 135/79, 98 NRB.

   Assessment and Plan: 89 yo F with minimal medical history now s/p hip
   replacement on [**2177-4-7**] now presents with hypoxia.
   .
   # Hypoxia/Pleural effusions: Improving on NC after putting out 1.5 L to
   lasix in ED. CT reveals effusions, but no obvious consolidations. CTA
   negative for PE. Cardiac workup unrevealing so far. Was given
   antibiotics in ED, but afebrile and without leukocytosis. Exam without
   JVP and only mild edema, but does have fluid on CXR. Flash may be in
   the setting of rapid reduction in lasix yesterday.
   - F/u BNP
   - Complete ROMI
   - IS at bedside Q1H given post op atelectasis on imaging
   - Lasix prn to goal net negative 1-2 L today
   - FS aspirin
   - Continue statin
   - Repeat CXR in AM
   - F/u CT chest final read
   - TTE to evalute EF
   - Consider thoracentesis if not improving, or febrile
   .
   # LLE swelling: Likely swelling related to recent surgery. Unlikely DVT
   as has been on ppx.
   - Continue SQH
   - Consider LENI if does not improve with lasix
   .
   # S/p hip replacement: Was on coumadin, but will transition to sqh for
   now. Continue tylenol, celebrex, oxycodone prn. [**Month (only) 11**] want to consider
   d/c celebrex if going to anticoagulate long term.
   .
   # Hypertension: Continue norvasc with holding parameters
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, cardiac/low N diet
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, ppi, mucomyst x 4 doses since
   received contrast
