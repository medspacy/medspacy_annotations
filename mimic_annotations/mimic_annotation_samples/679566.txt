   #. Hypoxic respiratory failure:  continue with 6L NC oxygen, titrate as
   tolerated.
   -change liquid bactrim to po
   -f/u sputum cultures
   -d/c steroids
    -uptitrate O2 prior to patient moving
   -appreciate thoracics involvement; pt with worsening PTX after
   pneumostat placed
 thus placed on suction
 now on water seal with
   plan to go home on water seal
   #. Afib:
   - continue dig for rate control
   - restart metoprolol 12.5 mg po TID for rate control
   #. Rheumatoid arthritis:
   - hold methotrexate and humira
   #. Macrocytic Anemia: Unclear etiology. Consider anemia of chronic
   disease. MTX could be contributory. B12 and folate WNL.
