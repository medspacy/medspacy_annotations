   74 y/o F with COPD, RSV, slow to come off bipap, now requiring it only
   at night.
   New thrombocytopenia with anemia with normal D-dimer and fibrinogen,
   but e/o hemolysis with high LDH, low Hapto and dropping Hct. HIT neg.
   Started on stress dose steroids for ? ITP and on argatroban for ? HIT.
   DD includes ITP and TTP. Off Bactrim, switched to atovaquone, which is
   also d/ced to minimize meds. F/u Heme recs. Transfusion goals plt 10K,
   Hct 25. Repeat smear today. Trend labs. Frantionate bili. D/C ASA.
   Review med list.
   Acute and chronic respiratory failure: Wean bipap as tolerated.
   Steroids for COPD + heme process.
   Needs dynamic airway CT for TBM when stable.
   ID: On Fluc for yeast in urine and sputum.
   I/O: keep even, watch BUN
