[**2140-12-4**]:
   VIRAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    No Virus isolated so far.

   Rapid Respiratory Viral Antigen Test (Final [**2140-12-6**]):
      Respiratory viral antigens not detected.

[**2140-12-8**]: PET: IMPRESSION: 1) New 3.2 x 3.4 cm area of increased
FDG uptake in consolidated left upper lung. Persistent FDG-avid
consolidated opacities in the right upper lobe. Persistent
FDG-avid nodular pleural thickening in the right lung base.
Decreased right pleural effusion. 2) Increased uptake in the
shoulder muscles and left posterolateral chest wall musculature.
While some of this may physiologic, there is a suggestion of
slight thickening in the chest wall musculature. It is uncertain
whether this may also represent lymphomatous involvement.

[**12-9**] CT abdomen:
IMPRESSION:
1) Small amount of nonocclusive tumor thrombus located around
catheter within SVC.
2) Multiple right pulmonary nodules with nodular areas of
pleural thickening.
3) Focal consolidation in the right upper lobe with several
nodular areas, unchanged since the prior FDG PET CT, allowing
for differences in technique.
4) Multiple nonpathologically enlarged mediastinal, periportal,
and retroperitoneal lymph nodes. Spleen normal in size.

[**12-9**] CTA chest:
1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2.  Nearly completely occlusive thrombus within the distal
superior vena cava
at the tip of the central line.
3.  Improved areas of parenchymal consolidation in the right
upper lobe.
.
[**12-9**] CT Head: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P 39 yo male with relapsed Hodgkins Disease on CEPP chemo, w/
SVC syndrome here for TPA infusion via portocath.

1. SVC syndrome - The patient was admitted to the ICU. He was
started on a heparin drip. He had an infusion of low dose TPA
with no change in fibrinogen or INR but the follow up venogram
showed some residual clot. He then underwent mechanical removal
with the Possis angiojet and suction thrombectomy of about 80%
of this clot. There was some residual clot but there was free
flow in the superior vena cava so it was left. He was maintained
on heparin gtt and transferred to the floor.  He was started on
coumadin in addition to the heparin, but after several days of
uptitrating the dose, he still remained subtherapeutic. He
remained clinically stable during this time, so the decision was
made to switch him to lovenox so he could be discharged. He was
maintained on heparin for several hours after starting lovenox,
then his heparin was stopped. He was d/cd to home after the case
manager assured that his insurance would cover part of the
lovenox.
.
2. Hodgkins Lymphoma- The patient recently finished his second
cycle of CEPP. A repeat PET was done on [**12-8**] which showed
possible new disease in the LUL and stable disease in the RL. A
follow up CT showed multiple right pulmonary nodules with
nodular areas of pleural thickening, but no new disease in the
LUL. At that point, it was decided to send the patient home with
no further chemotherapy and to consider harvesting the patient
for an autologous stem cell transplant instead of doing the 3rd
cycle of CEPP.

3) Focal consolidation in the right upper lobe with several
nodular areas - most likely c/w Hodgkins Lymphoma as present
since [**2140-4-7**] despite several trials of antibiotics. Since
the patient was neutropenic and having fevers, a possible new
pneumonia could not be ruled out. He was started on
cefepime/vanco and then when he was no longer neutropenic, the
cefepime was changed to levofloxacin. All of his antibiotics
were then stopped when he became afebrile. The RUL consolidation
persisted on follow up CT and was felt to be c/w HL.

4. Pain control- The pt has bilateral leg pain from
chemotherapy. In the ICU, the pain was managed w/ short acting
oxycodone because they wanted to follow his MS during the tpa
infusion. Once he was transferred to the floor, he was started
on oxycontin twice a day with oxycodone for breakthrough. His
oxycontin was titrated upt to 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] with oxycodone for
breakthrough for optimal pain control. He was discharged on this
regimen.
.
4. Prophylaxis- The patient was anticoagulated throughout the
admission for his SVC clot. He was also maintained on colace and
senna while on narcotics.
