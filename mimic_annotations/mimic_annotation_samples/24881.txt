HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS INCLUDING PERTINENT LABORATORY
DATA:
1.  Respiratory: [**Known lastname 14552**] had worsening grunting, flaring,
    and retracting. She was initially on nasal cannula O2,
    but was transitioned to continuous positive airway
    pressure. She continued to require 50-60% oxygen and with
    her increased work of breathing, was electively intubated
    and received 2 doses of surfactant. She self-extubated on
    day of life #3. She had increasing respiratory distress
    and was found to have a left pneumothorax on chest x-ray.
    This was treated with thoracentesis and eventual chest
    tube placement.

By day of life #5, she had weaned to nasal cannula O2. The
chest tube was removed on [**2150-8-27**]. She transitioned
to room air on day of life #7 and continued in room air
through the rest of her neonatal intensive care unit
admission. Chest x-rays were consistent with surfactant
deficiency.

At the time of discharge, she was breathing comfortably in
room air with a respiratory rate of 30-60 breaths per minute.

1.  Cardiovascular: [**Known lastname 14552**] has maintained normal heart
    rates and blood pressures. A murmur was noted on day of
    life #2. An electrocardiogram was obtained and was within
    normal limits. [**Known lastname 14552**] was evaluated by the cardiology
    consult team from [**Hospital3 1810**]. They recommend
    followup 1 month after discharge. An echocardiogram was not
    felt to be indicated. At the time of
    discharge, the murmur remained audible at the left
    sternal border. Baseline heart rate is 130-150 beats per
    minute. Recent blood pressure was 79/44 with a mean of
    53.

1.  Fluid, electrolytes, and nutrition: [**Known lastname 14552**] was
    initially NPO and maintained on intravenous fluids.
    Enteral feeds were started on day of life #4 and
    gradually advanced to full volume. At the time of
    discharge, she is ad-lib p.o. feeding Enfamil 24 calories
    per ounce. Weight on the day of discharge is 2.7
    kilograms. Serum electrolytes were checked on the 1st
    week of life and were within normal limits.

1.  Infectious disease: Due to the unknown etiology of the
    respiratory distress, [**Known lastname 14552**] was evaluated for sepsis.
    A complete blood count drawn upon admission to the
    neonatal intensive care unit was within normal limits. A
    blood culture was obtained prior to starting intravenous
    antibiotics. The blood culture was no growth at 48 hours
    and the antibiotics were discontinued.

1.  Hematological: Hematocrit at birth was 48.6%. [**Known lastname 14552**]
    did not receive any transfusions of blood products.

1.  Gastrointestinal: [**Known lastname 14552**] required treatment for
    unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia with phototherapy. Peak
    serum bilirubin occurred on day of life #4, total of
    13.6/0.3 mg per deciliter direct. She was treated with
    phototherapy for approximately 3 days. Rebound bilirubin
    on [**2150-8-30**] was 10.7/0.5 mg per deciliter direct.

1.  Neurological: [**Known lastname 14552**] has maintained a normal
    neurological exam, and there were no neurological
    concerns at the time of discharge.

1.  Sensory: Audiology. Hearing screening was performed with
    automated auditory brainstem responses. [**Known lastname 14552**] passed
    in both ears.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  Is home with the parents. The primary
pediatrician is Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 62593**] [**Name (STitle) **], [**Hospital 620**] Pediatrics, [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 62594**], [**Location (un) 620**], [**Numeric Identifier 46003**], phone #[**Telephone/Fax (1) 37814**].

CARE AND RECOMMENDATIONS AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE:
1.  Feeding: Ad-lib p.o. feeding Enfamil 24 calories per
    ounce.
2.  No medications.
3.  Car seat position screening was performed. [**Known lastname 14552**] was
    observed in her car seat for 90 minutes without any
    episodes of oxygen desaturation or bradycardia.
4.  State newborn screen initially was sent on day of life
    #3. The 170-H-P were elevated. A repeat screen was sent
    on [**2150-9-2**] and the results remain pending at the
    time of discharge.
5.  Immunizations received. Hepatitis B vaccine was
    administered on [**2150-9-2**].
6.  Immediate recommended: Synagis RSV prophylaxis should be
    considered from [**Month (only) **] through [**Month (only) 958**] for infants who
    meet any of the following 3 criteria: 1. Born at less
    than 32 weeks; 2. Born between 32 and 35 weeks with 2 of
    the following: Daycare during the RSV season, a smoker in
    the household, neuromuscular disease, airway
    abnormalities, or school-age siblings; or 3. With chronic
    lung disease.
7. The patient was born in breech position. In accordance with
AAP guidelines, a hip ultraosund is suggested during early
infancy.

Influenza immunization is recommended annually in the fall
for all infants once they reach 6 months of age. Before this
age and for the first 24 months of the child's life,
immunization against influenza is recommended for household
contacts and out-of-home caregivers.

FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENTS:
1.  Appointment with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], primary pediatrician within 3
    days of discharge.
2.  Pediatric cardiology 1 month.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Prematurity at 35-6/7 weeks gestation.
2.  Respiratory distress syndrome.
3.  Suspicion for sepsis ruled out.
4.  Left pneumothorax.
5.  Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.
