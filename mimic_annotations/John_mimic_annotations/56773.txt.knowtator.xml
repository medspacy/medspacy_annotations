        <spannedText>On [**4-4**], with the patient's sedation completely weaned, he was found to be more awake, was spontaneously eye opening and with dysconjugate gaze. He remained relatively stable for the next couple of days with relatively well controlled intracranial pressures with ventriculostomy. On [**2175-4-5**] the patient was stable and it was decided additionally to discontinue his Dilantin which he had been on at the time of admission. The patient had no seizure activity noted throughout his hospitalization. On [**4-5**], additionally with the patient ventilator-dependent for a period of approximately two weeks at this point, it was decided to perform both a percutaneous tracheostomy and percutaneous gastrostomy. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 1180**] performed both of these procedures. He tolerated them well without any complications. On [**2175-4-6**], with the patient's intracranial pressures well controlled and consistently under 20, it was decided to begin weaning the patient's ventriculostomy catheter. His catheter was weaned and discontinued on [**2175-4-8**]. On [**4-7**], the patient continued to do well. His urine output was good. At this point his arterial line was discontinued. His ventilatory support was weaned back to tracheostomy mask. He was breathing spontaneously on his own. The patient did well for the next several days. His neurological examination improved such that he was able to open his eyes to stimuli. His pupils were noted to be large and reactive, approximately 6.4 mm. He was able to localize to pain, with his upper extremities and then withdraw in his lower extremities to stimulation and at the time was noted to be moving all four extremities. On [**2175-4-9**] the patient was taken to the Operating Room with the Oral Maxillofacial Surgery Service with Plastic Surgery. At that time, his maxilla and mandible fractures were repaired. An antibiotic regimen of Unasyn 1.5 gm q. 8 hours was obtained for several days postoperatively. The patient was kept with a wire cutter at bedside for postoperative care. He tolerated these procedures well without complications and returned to the Trauma Surgery Intensive Care Unit postoperatively. Postoperatively the patient was maintained with a cross stitch in the left eye for 48 hours, Peridex mouthwash. The patient remained stable for the next several days. He was tolerating tube feeds well and required frequent suctions but otherwise tolerated from an upper respiratory standpoint. On [**4-10**], the patient returned to the Operating Room with the Orthopedic Service where they removed the external fixator device from his left tibia-fibula fracture repair. They were able to close his wound primarily over this repair. Mr. [**Known lastname **] remained stable postoperatively with lowgrade temperatures into the 100 to 101 gradually. Over the next several days his secretions decreased in the unit and he required less frequent suctioning and respiratory care. On [**2175-4-17**] the patient did well requiring less frequent suctioning. He was transferred off of the Trauma Floor with tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube. At this point he was tolerating tube feeds well without difficulty. On [**2175-4-17**] the Physical Therapy Service was consulted for their initial evaluation. Their initial impression was that the patient would need acute traumatic brain injury rehabilitation stay following discharge. They continued to work with the patient throughout his hospitalization prolonged secondary to insurance issues, being that the patient was from [**Location (un) 5299**] and had neither [**State 1145**] nor [**Location (un) 5299**] insurance. The patient continued to do well on the general floor over the subsequent two weeks following his transfer. His neurological examination progressively improved such that the patient was awake spontaneously throughout the day, moving all extremities, responding to a variety of external stimuli. After adequate time on the floor the patient was seen frequently by the Respiratory Care Service who administered the patient a treatment regimen of a list of nebulizers, chest physical therapy and some infrequent suctioning. During these weeks the [**Hospital 8653**] Rehabilitation Service at the hospital was consulted who again felt that Mr. [**Known lastname **] was having very serious traumatic brain injury, certainly needs to move to a facility where there was active rehabilitation for his injuries. Mr. [**Known lastname **] continued to do well on the floor here with a stable examination and was seen intermittently by Physical Therapy and Occupational therapy Services. He continued to tolerate his tube feeds well without difficulty and had progressively less oxygen requirements and respiratory care requirements.</spannedText>
