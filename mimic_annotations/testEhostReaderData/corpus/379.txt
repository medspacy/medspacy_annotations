HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 55-year-old
male with a history of end-stage renal disease on
hemodialysis QMWF, hepatitis C, hypertension,
and type 2 diabetes, who was recently admitted to
the [**Hospital6 256**] in [**2154-2-16**]
with a question of cellulitis versus an allergy related to
his newly revised AV fistula.

Recently, the patient had begun to feel slightly out of the
ordinary about a week prior to presentation with some fatigue
and lethargy initially without any cough, fever, or chills.
Subsequently, the patient developed some back and chest
soreness with achiness in the right chest with radiation to
the back.  The patient did not go to his scheduled
hemodialysis on Friday because he did not feel well.
Instead, he went to the [**Hospital3 **] Emergency Department
where he had a CT and chest x-ray where he was diagnosed with
osteoarthritis and discharged.

The patient then went to hemodialysis the subsequent day.  He
had a temperature of 102 that night.  Again, the patient
presented to the [**Hospital3 **] Emergency Room where he had a
chest x-ray showing pneumonia.  At that point, the patient
preferred admission to the [**Hospital6 2018**] and presented to the Emergency Room on the same night.

At this time, the initial read of his chest x-ray showed no
evidence of pneumonia and the patient was sent home with the
diagnosis of costochondritis.  Since this time, which was on
[**2154-4-21**], the patient has had increasing lethargy and
awoke confused and febrile to 102, at which time again he was
brought back to [**Hospital6 256**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Type 2 diabetes for the past 21 years complicated by
retinopathy, nephropathy.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  End-stage renal disease, on hemodialysis since [**2153-9-16**].  AV fistula placed at outside hospital with
subsequent revisions times two.
4.  History of C. difficile colitis.
5.  Diverticulosis.
6.  Status post cholecystectomy.
7.  Hepatitis C.
8.  History of questionable CHF, likely secondary to volume
overload from ineffective dialysis.
9.  Cardiovascular:  Echocardiogram in [**2154-1-16**] was a
limited study, EF greater than 55%, mild symmetric LVH.  No
known wall motion abnormalities or valvular disease.
10. Parathyroid adenoma in left lower pole of thyroid.

LABORATORY DATA AT THE TIME OF ADMISSION:  White blood cell
count 9.5, hematocrit 34.9, platelets 254,000.  Differential:
Neutrophils 84.7%, bands 0%, lymphocytes 9.9%, monocytes
4.9%, eosinophils 0.1%, basophils 0.3%.

Sodium 136, potassium 4.9, chloride 89, bicarbonate 28, BUN
49, creatinine 8.9, glucose 110.  Calcium 10.5, magnesium
2.0, phosphorus 10.4.

Chest x-ray:  Rapid interval development of diffuse
right-sided consolidation with tracheal shifting concerning
for collapse or plugging, also with left upper lobe
infiltrates.

EKG:  Increased T waves in inferior leads in V6, ST slightly
increased in lead V1.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  PULMONARY:  The patient initially was
admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit given his
profound hypoxia with a saturation of 66% on room air and his
chest x-ray which showed rapid development within one day of
what was initially read as a small questionable left lower
lobe infiltrate on [**2154-4-21**] and a chest x-ray on [**2154-4-22**] with diffuse right-sided consolidation as well as
left upper lobe infiltrate.

The patient was started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin.  He
persistently had a dry cough without any sputum.  The patient
was initially on a 50% face mask at which time he desaturated
to the high 90s.  He was changed to a nonrebreather.
Subsequently, on nonrebreather he had an ABG of 7.42, 41, 77.

The patient was then weaned off oxygen from face mask to
nasal cannula and had a requirement of approximately 5-6
liters of oxygen.  At this time, he was transferred to the
medical floor where he was rapidly weaned to a saturation of
92% on room air.  The patient was continued on a total of a
five day course of azithromycin as well as a five day course
of IV ceftriaxone which was then changed to cefpodoxime/
proxetil at 400 mg p.o. q.d. for an additional nine days to
complete a total of a 14 day course.

The patient had a repeat chest x-ray on [**2154-4-25**] that
showed complete resolution of all of his prior infiltrates.
The patient also had significant improvement in his lung
examination.

2.  HYPERTENSION:  The patient was maintained on his home
dose antihypertensive regimen with some initial holding of
his Lopressor in the Intensive Care Unit which was
subsequently restarted on the floor secondary to his elevated
blood pressures.

3.  RENAL FAILURE:  The patient was continued on his usual
regimen of hemodialysis.  Given his hyperphosphatemia, the
patient was increased from 800 mg of Sevelamer p.o. t.i.d.
with meals to 1,600 mg p.o. t.i.d. with meals.

4.  RIGHT FOOT ULCER:  Initially this was stable with no
signs of fluctuants or infection.  The patient was seen by
the Podiatry Service and according to Podiatry
recommendations the patient was treated with b.i.d. to t.i.d.
wet-to-dry dressing changes as well as antibiotic ointment
intermittently.  The patient had his wounds debrided by his
attending physician on one to two occasions.  The patient
continued to have subsequent limitation in his mobility
secondary to deconditioning as well as his right foot ulcer.

The patient was seen by the Physical Therapy Service and
recommendations for transfer to a [**Hospital 3058**] rehabilitation
facility were made.

5.  DIABETES MELLITUS:  The patient was continued on his home
dose antidiabetic regimen with NPH and sliding scale insulin
with good glycemic control.

6.  DISPOSITION:  The patient continued to have improvement
from his initial pneumonia; however, he was still hypoxic to
92% on room air.  In addition, the patient was significantly
deconditioned and fatigued, likely secondary to his dialysis
as well.  The patient's right foot ulcer also limited his
mobility.

The patient will be transferred to the [**Hospital 38**]
Rehabilitation Facility on [**2154-4-27**].

The patient was also seen by the Social Work Transplant
Center who met with the patient's wife as well.
