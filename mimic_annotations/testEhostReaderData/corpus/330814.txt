   Assessment and Plan
   47 yr old woman with morbid obesity, OSA and obesity hypoventilation,
   presents to OSH with Afib and ?decompensated systolic heart failure s/p
   diuresis at OSH complicated by acute resp decoimpensation at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 1415**]
   today
   1.       Hypercarbic and Hypoxemic Resp Failure: etiology likely OSA,
   hypoventilation, but possible component of reactive airways. Plan-
   BIPAP 15/5 as trial and wean FIO2- current ABG looks good 7.33. Need to
   assess chem 7 here as she has a significantly elevated HCo3 in setting
   of retention and diuresis. Convert Medrol to 40 prednisone,
   alb/atrovent nebs. Check CXR to assess parenchyma as right greater than
   left sided wheezes.
   2.       SVT: converted with cardioversion and sent over on both Amio
   and Digoxin. Check Dig level, clarify how many days of Amio 400 TID as
   may be able to taper.
   3.       Right Arm Pain s/p PICC: check US to rule out clot
