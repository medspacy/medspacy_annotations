Chief Complaint: Transfer from [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for XRT on [**Hospital Ward Name **] with
   respiratory failure [**1-7**] post-obstructive PNA
   24 Hour Events:
   In summary, this is a 72 y/o male with COPD, CAD s/p angioplasty in
   [**2180**], afib and small cell lung CA who started [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 2007**] [**8-19**] with
   carboplatin/VP-16 in [**State 395**].  He initially presented to SMMC on [**8-23**]
   with hypotension after accidental overdose on diltiazem.  There, a CXR
   showed R lung white out and was transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for bronch given
   concern for mass compression of the bronchus.  Chest CT at [**Hospital1 19**] showed
   large centrally obstructing mass with right apical pneumothorax, right
   middle and lower lobe opacity, pigtail was placed.  Patient was then
   bronched on [**8-24**] with purulent drainage, stent was placed and started
   on Vanco/Zosyn for presumed post-obstructive pneumonia.  Patient
   continued to be intubated after the bronch and developed hypotension
   requiring pressors.  Patient also noted to be neutropenic thought
   likely [**1-7**] [**Month/Day (2) 2007**] and sepsis and patient with afib with RVR on a dilt
   gtt.  This morning he was mapped for XRT and received his first dose of
   radiation.

   Assessment and Plan:  72 year old male with COPD, CAD initially
   presented with hypotension [**1-7**] diltiazem overdose, noted to have
   post-obstructive PNA requiring bronch and stent placement, PNX
   requiring chest tube placement, transferred from SICU for XRT with
   continued hypoxic respiratory failure and hypotension requiring
   pressors.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated for his procedure and
   not able to be weaned.  Likely multifactorial, from post-obstructive
   PNA, PNX, and underlying lung disease (COPD).
   -continue nebs but d/c fluticasone
   -Wean Vent as tolerated
   -BNP, consider ECHO
   #Hypotension: [**Last Name (un) **] stim normal. Likely sepsis, though ?diltiazem for
   afib with RVR.
   -repeat blood cultures
   -U/A with urine culture
   -f/u sputum cultures
   -change propofol to fent/midaz
   #Pneumothorax:
   -continue chest tube
   #Pancytopenia: Likely [**1-7**] [**Month/Day (2) 2007**] and sepsis. Patient has been
   normo-temperature.
   -transfuse PLTs for bleeding or for <10
   -neutropenic precautions
   -continue neupogen
   #Transaminitis: LFTs trending down, likely due to shock on top of known
   liver mets.
   -RUQ U/S
   #Afib: goal HR <100, on sotalol [**Hospital1 7**], holding anticoagulation given
   thrombocytopenia
   #Small Cell Lung CA: Followed by onc, would be due for next round of
   [**Hospital1 2007**] next week, but pending return of his counts.  Had head CT with
   and without and no mets.  Undergoing XRT.
   #?sinusitis seen on CT head.
