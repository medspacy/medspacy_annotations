Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1232**]
Chief Complaint:
gross hematuria

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p radical cystoprostastectomy, obturator and iliac LND, ileal
loop


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 75-year-old male who presented initially with
gross hematuria, was found to have bladder cancer which was
found to be T1 high grade with
CIS. He was restaged which showed invasion to the lamina propria
but also extensive glandular involvement of the prostate with no
stromal invasion. Due to his history, he presented for surgical
management. He has been followed by
pulmonary for pulmonary fibrosis which previously had shown BOOP
in the past on biopsy.


Past Medical History:
HTN
BPH
DM

Social History:
Has a 40 pack year h/o tobacco and quit at the age of 37.  He
works as a caretaker for women and currently lives with his
family.  He denies IVDU and drinks socially.

EOM full, PERRLA
Chest coarse throughout with bibasilar crackles
RRR, no MRG
Abdomen soft, appropriately tender, incision clean and dry

CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT

Reason: r/o pulmonary edema

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
75 year old man with h/o BOOP, s/p radical cystoprostatectomy
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o pulmonary edema
AP CHEST

HISTORY: BOOP. Rule out pulmonary edema.

IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**2158-11-25**] and [**2159-10-17**]:

Chronic interstitial pulmonary disease accounts for the bulk of
pulmonary abnormalities, but there is slight increase in
opacification in the left lower lobe, which could represent
pneumonia or aspiration and an increase in the background
density of the lungs, which may be a function of differing
radiologic technique or mild pulmonary edema. Nevertheless,
there is no mediastinal vascular engorgement, appreciable
increase in heart size or indication of substantial pleural
effusion to suggest congestive heart failure. Nasogastric tube
ends in the stomach.

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: pulmonary edema? ***pt will be on [**Hospital Ward Name **] in the
afterno

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
75M IPF, s/p radical cystoprostatectomy, ileal loop, POD1
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
pulmonary edema? ***pt will be on [**Hospital Ward Name **] in the
afternoon***
HISTORY: Postoperative with shortness of breath suggesting
pulmonary edema.

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**12-10**], the patient has
taken a much poorer inspiration. There is again diffuse
prominence of interstitial markings consistent with chronic
pulmonary disease. Some increasing opacification at the left
base may reflect some atelectasis or pneumonia or be a
manifestation of bronchiectatic changes from previous
inflammatory disease. The right IJ catheter again lies in the
upper superior vena cava. The nasogastric tube extends at least
to the upper stomach, though it is difficult to follow beyond
this point.

IMPRESSION: Little overall change.


Brief Hospital Course:
GU:  Pt admitted postoperatively after prostacystectomy with
ileal loop and ileostomy creation. The night of admission, the
pt's pain was well controlled with an epidural, and he was
monitored in the PACU without any complications.  On POD1, the
pt was transferred to the floor, where he remained
hemodynamically stable with good urine output from the
ileostomy, which appeared well vascularized and pink in color.
POD1, the pt was bolused on a few occasions for marginal urine
output, but by POD2, the pt was making adequate urine without
any additional fluids.

Pulm: Preop diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis, so pulmonology was
intimately involved in the pt's postoperative plan.  POD1, IV
fluids were held to keep the pt dry and breathing comfortably.
CXRs demonstrated no evidence of CHF or worsening pulmonary
processes.  By POD1, the pt was weaned to room air while
maintaining a saturation of 96%.  Intraoperatively, the pt
received stress dose steroids, which were weaned over the course
of his 6 day hospitalization, on discharge, the pt was
transitioned to prednisone 15 mg qd.

CV: The pt remained cardiovascularly stable throughout his
hospitalization.  He received IV lopressor periop and was
transitioned to his home dose of atenolol prior to discharge.
No episodes of chest pain, palpitations or other cardiac events.


GI: Postop the pt was NPO with an NGT in place.  Outputs
remained low on POD1-2, after which time the tube was pulled.
The pt remained NPO, and on POD3, after frequent flatus, the pt
was advanced to sips, then clears and finally regular diet on
POD4, which he tolerated well.

H: Postoperatively the pt received a dose of coumadin for PE
prophylaxis.  His INR rose from 1.4 to 1.7 on POD2 then down to
1.4 again on POD5.  After the INR dropped sufficiently, the
epidural was pulled without complication, and the pt was
discharged home on POD5.
